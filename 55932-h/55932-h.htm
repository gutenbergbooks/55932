  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Hazlitt’s father, a minister in the Unitarian Church, was the son of
an Antrim dissenter, who had removed to Tipperary; Hazlitt’s
mother was the daughter of a Cambridgeshire yeoman; so that there
is small room for wonder if Hazlitt were all his life distinguished by
a fine pugnaciousness of mind, a fiery courage, an excellent doggedness
of temper, and (not to crack the wind of the poor metaphor)
a brilliancy in the use of his hands unequalled in his time, and since
his time, by any writing Englishman. Of course, he was very much
else; or this monument to his genius would scarce be building, this
draft to his credit would have been drawn for To-Morrow on
To-Day. But, while he lived, his fighting talent was the sole thing
in his various and splendid gift that was evident to the powers that
were; and, inasmuch as he loved nothing so dearly as asserting
himself to the disadvantage of certain superstitions which the said
powers esteemed the very stuff of life, they did their utmost to
dissemble his uncommon merits, and to present him to the world
at large as a person whose morals were deplorable, whose nose was
pimpled, whose mind was lewd, whose character would no more
bear inspection than his English, whose heart and soul and taste were
irremediable, and who, as he persisted in regarding ‘the Corsican
fiend’ as a culmination of human genius and character, must for that
reason especially—(but there were many others)—be execrated as a
public enemy, and stuck in the pillory whenever, in the black malice
of his corrupt and poisonous heart, he sought, by feigning an affection
for Shakespeare, or an interest in metaphysics, to recommend his
vulgar, mean, pernicious personality to the attention of a loyal,
God-fearing, church-going, tax-paying, Pope-and-Pretender-hating
British Public. I cannot say that I regret the very scandalous
attacks that were made on Hazlitt: since, if they had not been, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>should have lacked some admirable pages in the <cite>Political Essays</cite> and
<cite>The Spirit of the Age</cite>, nor should we now be privileged to rejoice in
the dignified and splendid savagery of the <em>Letter to William Gifford</em>.
And, if I do not regret them for myself and the many who think
with me, still less can I wish them wanting for Hazlitt’s sake; for
if they had been, who shall say how dull and how profitless, how
weary and flat and stale, some years of what he described, in his last
words to his kind, as ‘a happy life’—how mean and beggarly may
not some days in these years have seemed? But there is, after all,
a reason for being rather sorry than not that Hazlitt’s polemic was
so brilliant, his young conviction so unalterably constant, his example so
detestable as it seemed to the magnificent ruffian in <cite>Blackwood</cite>
and the infinitely spiteful underling in <cite>The Quarterly</cite>. The British
Public of those days was a good, hard-hitting, hard-drinking, hard-living
lot; and, in the matter of letters, there was no guile in it. It
read its Campbell, its Rogers, its Moore, its Hook and Egan and
Jon Bee; it accepted its convinced and pedantic sycophant in
Southey, its gay, light-hearted protestant in Leigh Hunt; it
nibbled at its Wordsworth, knew not what to make of its Coleridge,
swallowed its Cobbett (that prince of pugilists) as its morning rasher
and toast; it made much of Hone, yet was far from contemptuous of
Westmacott; it laid itself open to its Scott and its Byron, Michael
and Satan, the Angel of Acceptance and the Angel of Revolt.
Withal it was essentially a Tory Public: a public long practised in
fearing God and honouring the King; with half an ear for Major
Cartwright and his like, and a whole mind for the story of Randal
and Cribb; honestly and jovially proud of Nelson and ‘The Duke,’
but neither loving the Emperor nor seeking to understand him.
Now, to Hazlitt the Revolution was humanity <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in excelsis</span></i>, while the
Emperor, being democracy incarnate, and so a complete expression
of character and human genius, was as his god. Gifford, then, and
Wilson, had small difficulty in blasting Hazlitt’s fame, and in so far
ruining Hazlitt’s chance that ’tis but now, after some seventy years,
that he takes his place in literary history as the hero of a Complete
Edition. In the meanwhile he has had praise, and praise again.
But it has come ever from the few, and he has yet to be considered
of the general as a critic of many elements in human activity, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>master of his mother-tongue, and one, and that one not the least, in
an epoch illustrious in the achievement of Keats and Shelley and
Wordsworth, the inimitable Cobbett, Byron and Sir Walter,
Coleridge, the Arch-Potency (who, ‘prone on the flood’ of failure,
ever ‘lies floating many a rood’), and the thrice-beloved Lamb.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>I</h3>

<p class='c011'>The elder Hazlitt was trained in Glasgow. A man of spirit and
understanding, an active and a vigilant minister, he married Grace
Loftus, the Wisbech yeoman’s daughter, in 1766; and in 1778 (he
being much older than she), the last of their children, their son
William, was born to them at Maidstone. Five years later this son
accompanied his parents to Philadelphia. There the elder Hazlitt
preached and lectured for some fifteen months; but in 1786–87,
having meanwhile established the earliest Unitarian church in America,
he returned to England, and settled at Wem, in Shropshire, which
was practically Hazlitt’s first taste of native earth. A precocious
youngster, well grounded by his father, himself a man of parts and
reading,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> he was responsible as early as 1792 for a <cite>New Theory of
Criminal and Civil Jurisprudence</cite>, and at fifteen he went to the
Unitarian College at Hackney, there to study for the ministry. But
his mind changed. In the meantime he learned something of literature,
something of metaphysics, something of painting, something (I
doubt not) of life; the Revolution blazed out, Bonaparte fell falconwise
upon Austrian Italy, and approved himself the greatest captain
since Marlborough; there was a strong unrest in time and the destiny
of man; the ambitions of life were changed, the possibilities and conditions
of life transformed. The skies thrilled with the dawn of a
new day, and Hazlitt: already, it is fair to conjecture, at grips with
that potent and implacable devil of sex which possessed him so
vigorously for so many years; already, too, the devout and militant
Radical, the fanatic of Bonaparte, he remained till the end: was no
longer for the pulpit. And at this moment existence was transfigured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>for him also. In the January of 1798, Coleridge, that embodied Inspiration,
visited the elder Hazlitt at Wem, and preached his last
(Unitarian) sermon in the chapel there. He was at his best, his
freshest, his most copious, his most expressive and persuasive; he
had the poet’s eye, the poet’s mouth, the poet’s voice, impulse,
authority, style; he had already ‘fed on honey-dew, and drunk the
milk of Paradise’; and he carried Hazlitt clean off his legs. To
the sombre, personal, scarce lettered but very thoughtful youth this
voluble and affecting Apparition was the bearer of a revelation.
He listened to Coleridge as to a John Baptist. He dared to talk
metaphysics, and was so far rewarded for his valour as to be encouraged
to persevere.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> What was of vastly greater importance, he
was asked to Stowey in the spring of the same year: an event from
which he dated the true beginnings of his intellectual life.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that centre of enchantment he stayed three weeks. It was a
Golden Year. Hazlitt was drunk throughout with what I should
like to call Neophytism. Coleridge was magnificent—elusive,
archimagian, irresistible; Wordsworth was opinionated but sublime;
at intervals, as in Sir Richard Burton’s <cite>Thousand Nights and a Night</cite>,
they ‘repeated the following verses.’ It was a time—O, but it
was a time! A time of ecstasy: ‘When proud-pied April was in
all his trim,’ and even ‘heavy Saturn’ must have laughed, if only to
keep his yoke-fellow, Wordsworth, in company; Wordsworth with
his thick airs, and his luminous Belt, and his dull but steady-going
group of Moons! A time of gold, I say; yet had it a most strange
outcome. In 1798 Coleridge and Wordsworth were Revolutionaries
in everything: they looked to France for liberty, for change, for a
shining and enduring example. Hazlitt was with them now and
here: his also was a revolutionary soul, he also was of a mind with
Danton, he also looked to France for leading and light, he also held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>the assault delivered upon France for an assault against Freedom.
But Coleridge and Wordsworth changed their minds, and readjusted
their points of view; and he did not. They loved not Bonaparte;
and he did. And the end of it was that, so far as I know, he never
wrote with so ripe and sensual a gust: not even, to my mind, when
he was merely annihilating Gifford: as when, long years after Nether-Stowey,
he broke in upon the strong, solid hold of Wordsworth’s
egotism, and tore to tatters—tatters which he flung upon the wind—the
old, greasy prophet’s mantle,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> which Coleridge had sported to so
little purpose for so many years. To Hazlitt, the dissenter born,
the deeply brooding, the inflexible—to Hazlitt, I say, these Twin-Stars
of the Romantic Movement were common turn-coats; and he
dealt with them on occasion as he thought fit. But he never lost
his interest in them; and when it comes to a comparison between
Wordsworth, the renegade, and Byron, the leader of storming-parties,
the captain of forlorn-hopes, then is his idiosyncrasy revealed.
He hacks and stabs, he jibes and sneers and denies, till there is no
Byron left, and the sole poet of the century is the ‘gentlemanly
creature—reads nothing but his own poetry, I believe,’—whose best
passages, in a moment of supreme geniality, he once likened, not to
their advantage, to those of ‘the classic Akenside.’</p>

<h3 class='c010'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>It was from Nether-Stowey that Hazlitt dated his regard for
poetry. But if literature came late to him, as (his father’s office and
his own metaphysical inklings aiding) it did, he ever cherished a
pure and ardent passion for it, once it had come. Yet he was by no
means widely read, and in his last years seldom finished a new book.
First and last, indeed, he was a man of few books and fewer authors.
Shakespeare, Burke, Cervantes, Rabelais, Milton, the <cite>Decameron</cite>, the
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouvelle Héloïse</span></cite> and the <cite>Confessions</cite>, Richardson’s epics of the parlour
and Fielding’s epics of the road—these things and their kind he read
intensely; and, when it pleased him to speak of them, it was ever in
the terms of understanding and regard. Yet it was long ere he had
any thought of writing; and it was necessity alone that made him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>man of letters. In the beginning, the Pulpit proving impossible, he
turned to painting for a career, and, after certain studies, presumably
under his elder brother John,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and possibly under Northcote, he
went to the Paris of the First Consul, and painted there for some
four months in a Louvre which the thrift of Bonaparte had
stored with the choicest plunder in Italian Art. I know not whether
or no he could ever have been a painter. Haydon, who neither
loved nor understood him, and was, besides, a man who could greatly
dare and ‘toil terribly’—Haydon says that he was at once too lazy
and too timid ever to succeed in painting: an art in which, as
Haydon showed, and as Millet was presently to say, ‘You must flay
yourself alive, and give your skin.’<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> I do not think that Hazlitt was
daunted by what may be called the painfulness of painting; for in
letters he was soon enough to prove that he had in him to face a
world in arms, and to tincture his writings, if need were, with the
best blood of his heart. In any case, after divers essays at copying
in the Louvre,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and certain attempts at portraiture on his return to
England,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> he found that he could not excel; that, in fact, he was
neither Titian nor Rembrandt, nor could he even be Sir Joshua. So
he painted no more, but went on <em>reading</em> certain painters: very much, I
assume, as he went on taking certain authors; because he loved them
for themselves, and found emotions—and not only emotions, but
sensations<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a>—in them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>His ideals are Claude, Rembrandt, Raphael, Poussin, Titian;
he gives you very gentlemanly and intelligent estimates of Watteau
and Velasquez; he has an eye—a right one—for Rubens and
Van Dyck; he exults in Jan Steen, has words of worth for
Ruysdael and Hobbima, and gives Turner as neat a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">croc-en-jambe</span></i> as
you could wish to see. But, despite his training and his gift, he is
no more in advance of his age than the best of us here and now.
To him the Carraccis and Salvator are <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sommités</span></i> of a kind; if, so far
as I remember, he will have nought to do with Carlo Dolci, he will
not do without his Guido; I have read no word of his on Lawrence,
no word of his on Constable, none on Morland; on Hogarth he is
chiefly literary, on Turner not much more than diabolically ingenious.
Wisely or not, he took pictures as he took books: they might be
few, but they must be good; and, not only good but, of (as he
believed) the best. If they were not, or if they were new, he drew
them not to his heart, nor adorned the chambers of his mind with
them. Those chambers were filled with good things long since done.
To him, then, what were the best things doing? It was his habit
to take the good thing on; savour its excellences to their last
sucket; meditate it strictly, jealously, privily, longingly; say, if it
must be so, a few last words about it—some for the painter, more for
the man of letters;<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and then...? Well, then he accepted the
situation. I do not know that he cared much for Keats; I do
know that he found Shelley impossible, that he was never an
exalted Wordsworthian, and that he hesitated—(ever so little, but he
hesitated!)—even at Charles Lamb. Politics and all, in truth, he
was a prophet who adored the past, and had but an infidel eye for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>the promise of the years. He was interested only in the highest
achievement; and to be the highest even that must lie behind him.
Thus, Fielding was good, and Rubens; Sir Joshua was good, and
so were Richardson and Smollett; so, likewise, Shakespeare was
good, and Raphael and Titian were good—these with Milton and
Rembrandt, and Burke and Rousseau and Boccaccio; and it was
well. Well with them, and well—especially well!—with him: they
had achieved, and here was he, the perfect lover, to whom their
achievement was as an enchanted garden, a Prospero’s Island abounding
in romantic and inspiring chances, unending marvels, miracles of
vision and solace and pure, perennial delight. And if these, the
‘Thrones, Dominations, Powers,’ had done their work, and were
venerable in it, so also in their degrees and sorts had Congreve and
Watteau, Sir Thomas Browne and Sir Anthony Van Dyck,
Wycherley and Jordaens; so had even Salvator and John Buncle.
In dealing with painters, and with purely painters’ pictures, Hazlitt
generally strikes a right note.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> But the man of letters in him is
inevitably first; and ’tis not insignificant that some of the ‘crack
passages’ in his writings about pictures are rhapsodies about places—Burleigh
or Oxford—or pieces of pure literature like that very
human and ingenious essay ‘On the Pleasures of Painting,’ which
is one of the best good things in <cite>Table Talk</cite>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>III</h3>

<p class='c011'>So Hazlitt the painter was gathered to his fathers, and in his stead
a Hazlitt reigned about whom the world knows little worth the
telling: a Hazlitt who abridged philosophers, and made grammars,
and compiled anthologies; a married and domesticated Hazlitt; a
Hazlitt with a son and heir, and a wife who seems to have cared as
little for his works and him as, in the long run, he assuredly cared
for her company and her. The lady’s name was Stoddart; she
was a brisk, inconsequent, unsexual sort of person—a friend of Mary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>Lamb; and, like the only Mrs. Pecksniff, ‘she had a small
property.’ It was situate at Winterslow, certain miles from
Salisbury, and Hazlitt, who loved the neighbourhood, and clung
to it till the end, has so far illustrated the name that, if there could
ever be a Hazlitt Cult, the place would instantly become a shrine.
It was a cottage, within easy walking distance of Wilton and
Stonehenge; and in 1812 the Hazlitts, who were made one in
1808, departed it—it and the well-beloved woods of Norman
Court—for 19 York Street, Westminster.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Hence it was that he
issued to deliver his first course of lectures;<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and here it was that
he entertained those friends he had, made himself a reputation by
writing in papers and magazines, drank hard, and cured himself of
drinking, and long ere the end came found his wife insufferable. In
the beginning he worked in the Reporters’ Gallery, where he made
notes (in long hand) for <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite>, and learned to take
more liquor than was good for him.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> In this same journal he
printed some of his best political work, and broke ground as a
critic of acting; and he left it only because he could not help
quarrelling with its proprietors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another stand-by of his was <cite>The Champion</cite>, to his work in which
he owed a not unprofitable connexion with <cite>The Edinburgh</cite>; yet
another, <cite>The Examiner</cite>, to which, with much dramatic criticism, he
contributed, at Leigh Hunt’s suggestion, the set of essays reprinted
as <cite>The Round Table</cite>, and in which he may therefore be said to have
discovered his avocation, and given the measure of his best quality.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>Then, in 1817, he published his <cite>Characters of Shakespeare</cite>, which he
dedicated to Charles Lamb; in 1818 he reprinted a series of lectures
(at the Surrey Institute) on the English poets;<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> in 1819–20 he
delivered from the same platform two courses more—on the Comic
Writers and the Age of Elizabeth. He wrote for <cite>The Liberal</cite>, <cite>The
Yellow Dwarf</cite>, <cite>The London Magazine</cite>—(to which he may very well
have introduced the unknown Elia)—<cite>Colburn’s New Monthly</cite>; he
returned to the <cite>Chronicle</cite> in 1824; in 1825 he published <cite>The
Spirit of the Age</cite>, in 1826 <cite>The Plain Speaker</cite>, the <cite>Boswell Redivivus</cite>
in 1827; and in this last year he set to work, at Winterslow, on a
life of Napoleon. That was the beginning of the end. He had no
turn for history, nor none for research; his methods were personal,
his results singular and brief; he was as it were an accidental writer,
whose true material was in himself. His health broke, and worsened;
his publishers went bankrupt; he lost the best part of the £500
which he had hoped to earn by his work; and though, consulting
none but anti-English authorities, he lived to complete a book containing
much strong thinking and not a few striking passages, it was a
thing foredoomed to failure: a matter in which the nation, still hating
its tremendous enemy, and still rejoicing in the man and the battle
which had brought him to the ground, would not, and could not take
an interest. Two volumes were published in 1828 (Sir Walter’s
<cite>Napoleon</cite> appeared in 1827), and two more in 1830; but the work of
writing them killed the writer.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> His digestion, always feeble, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>ruined; and in the September of 1830 he died. He was largely, I
should say, a sacrifice to tea, which he drank, in vast quantities, of
extraordinary strength. However this be, his ending was (as he’d
have loved to put it) ‘as a Chrissom child’s.’<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>IV</h3>

<p class='c011'>Thus much, thus all-too little, of his course in print. For his
life, despite his many ‘bursts of confidence,’ the admissions of his
grandson, and the discoveries of such friends as Patmore, the half
of it, I think, has to be told to us. This was not his fault, for
he was in no sense secretive: he would no more lie about himself
than he would lie about Southey or Gifford. His trick of drinking
was, while it lasted, public; he proclaimed with all his lungs his
frank and full approval of the fundamentals of the Revolution and his
preference of Bonaparte before all the Kings in Europe; he despised
Shelley the politician, and rejected Shelley the poet, and he cherished
and made the most he could of his resentment against Coleridge and
Wordsworth, though his disdain for concealment perilled his friendship
with Lamb, and well nigh cost him the far more facile regard of
Leigh Hunt; while, as for Byron, he so bitterly resented the ‘noble
Lord’s’ pre-eminency that he made no difference, strongly as he
contemned the Laureate, between the Laureate’s <cite>Vision of Judgment</cite>,
a piece of English verse immortal by the sheer force of its absurdity,
and that other <cite>Vision of Judgment</cite>, which is one of the great
things in English poetry. ’Twas much the same in life. Poor
Mrs. Hazlitt, though she was well-read, of no account as an housekeeper,
‘fond of incongruous finery,’ and capable of child-bearing
withal, was, one may take for granted, not distinguished as a woman.
Now, her husband, thinker as he approved himself, was very much of
a male. Who runs may read of his early loves—Miss Railton and
the rest; ’tis history—at any rate ’tis history according to Wordsworth<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a>—that
once, in Lakeland, he so dealt with the local beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>that he came very near to tasting of the local pond; when Patmore
walked home with him to Westminster, after his first lecture in the
Surrey Institute, the wayside nymphs flocked to his encounter, and—(so
Patmore says)—he knew them all;<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> he has himself recorded the
confession that in the matter of mob-caps and black stockings and red
elbows—in fact, on the score of your maid-servant—he could flourish
a list as long, or thereabouts, as Leporello’s. I know not whether
he lied or spoke the truth;<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> but I can scarce believe that he lied. I
should rather opine that on this point, as on others, Hazlitt, a gross
and extravagant admirer (be it remembered) of J.-J. Rousseau,
was, and is, entirely credible. We may take it that his veracity is
beyond reproach. But ’tis another matter with his taste; and for
that I can say no more than that I have listened to so many confidences:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From some we loved, the loveliest and the best</div>
      <div class='line'>That from his Vintage rolling Time has pressed:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>that I hold it for merely unessential.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the man who habitually hugs his housemaid is, whether he
boast of it or not, no more superior to consequences than another:
especially if he have, as Hazlitt had, an ardent imagination and a
teeming waste of sentiment. And so Hazlitt found. About 1819
he ceased from consorting with his wife; and in 1820 he lodged with
a tailor, one Walker, in Southampton Buildings, Chancery Lane.
Walker, a most respectable man, had daughters, and one of these, a
girl well broken-in, it would seem, to the ways of ‘gentlemen’—a
girl with a dull eye, a ‘sinuous gait,’ and a habit of sitting on the
knees of ‘gentlemen’; a girl, in fine, who is only to be described by
an old and sane and homely but unquotable designation—this poor
half-harlot took on our Don Juan of the area, and brought him to
utter grief. He looked at passion, as embodied in Sarah Walker,
until it grew to be the world to him; he went about like a man
drunken and dazed, telling the story of his slighted love to anybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>that would listen to it;<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> now he raved and was rampant, now was
he soul-stricken and heart-broken; he swore he’d marry Walker
whether she would or not, and to this end he persuaded his wife to
follow him to Edinburgh, and there divorce him—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour cause</span></i>, as the
lady and her legal adviser had every reason to believe;<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and having
achieved a divorce, which was no divorce in law, and been finally
refused by the young woman in Southampton Buildings, he set to
work assiduously to coin his madness into drachmas, and wrote, always
with Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his eye, that <em>Liber Amoris</em> which the
unknowing reader will find in our Second Volume. It is a book by
no means bad—if you can at all away with it. Indeed, it is unique in
English, and the hundred guineas Hazlitt got for it were uncommonly
well earned. But to away with it at all—that is the difficulty; and,
as it varies with the temperaments of them that read the book, I shall
discourse no more of it, but content myself with noting that, in
writing the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Amoris</span></i>, Hazlitt wrote off Sarah Walker.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> He
had been in love with a housemaid, but he had been very much more
in love with his love; and, having wearied all he knew with descriptions
of his feelings, he wrote those feelings down, cleared his system,
and became himself again. ’Twas Goethe’s way, I believe—his and
many another’s; the world will scarce get disaccustomed to it while
there are women and writing men. What distinguishes Hazlitt
from a whole wilderness of self-chroniclers is the fulness of his
revelation. It is extraordinary; but, even so, Rousseau had shown
him the way. And perhaps the simple truth about the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber</span></i> is that
it is the best Rousseau—the best and the nearest to the <cite>Confessions</cite>—done
since Rousseau died.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sarah Hazlitt married no more; but her husband did. In 1824
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>he took to wife a certain Mrs. Bridgewater. She was Scots by birth,
had lived much abroad, had married and buried a Colonel Bridgewater,
was of excellent repute, and had about £300 a year; and
with her new husband and his son by Sarah Stoddart—(who had
an idea that his mother had been wronged, and seems to have been
a most uncomfortable travelling companion)—she toured it awhile in
France and Italy. On the return journey the Hazlitts left her in
Paris; and when the elder, writing from London, asked her when
she purposed to come home to him, she replied that she did not
purpose to come home to him: that, in fact, she had done with
him, and he would see her no more. So far as I know, he never
did; so that, as his grandson says, this second marriage was but
‘an episode.’ Apparently it was the last in his life; for neither
Mrs. Hazlitt attended him in his mortal illness, nor was there any
woman at his bed’s head when he passed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>V</h3>

<p class='c011'>It is told of him that he was dark-eyed and dark-haired, slim in
figure, rather slovenly in his habit; that he valued himself on his
effect in evening dress; that his manners were rather ceremonious
than easy; that he had a wonderfully eloquent face, with a mouth
as expressive as Kean’s, and a frown like the Giaour’s own<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a>—that
Giaour whom he did not love. He worshipped women, but was
awkward and afraid with them; he played a good game of fives, and
would walk his forty to fifty miles a day; he would lie a-bed till two
in the afternoon, then rise, dally with his breakfast until eight without
ever moving from his tea-pot and his chair, and go to a theatre, a
bite at the Southampton, and talk till two in the morning.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> That he
excelled in talk is beyond all doubt. Witness after witness is here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>to his wit, his insight, his grip on essentials, his beautiful trick of
paradox, his brilliancy in attack, his desperate defence, his varying,
far-glancing, inextinguishable capacity for expression. And he was
himself—Hazlitt: a man who borrowed nobody’s methods, set no
limits to the field of discussion, nor made other men wonder if this
were no talk but a lecture. He bore no likeness to that ‘great but
useless genius,’ Coleridge: who, beginning well as few begin, lived
ever after ‘on the sound of his own voice’; none to Wordsworth,
whose most inspiring theme was his own poetry; none to Sheridan,
who ‘never oped his mouth but out there flew’ a jest; none to Lamb,
who——But no; I cannot imagine Lamb in talk. Hazlitt himself
has plucked out only a tag or two of Lamb’s mystery; and I own
that, even in the presence of the notes in which he sets down Lamb
as Lamb was to his intimates, I am divided in appreciation between
the pair. Lamb for the unexpected, the incongruous, the profound,
the jest that bred seriousness, the pun that was that and a light upon
dark places, a touch of the dread, the all-disclosing Selene, besides;
Hazlitt for none of these but for himself; and what that was I have
tried to show. Well; Lamb, Coleridge, Sheridan, Hazlitt, Hunt,
Wordsworth—all are dead, tall men of their tongues as they were.
And dead is Burke, and Fox is dead, and Byron, most quizzical of
lords! And of them all there is nothing left but their published
work; and of those that have told us most about some of them, ‘in
their habit as they lived,’ the best and the strictest-seeing, the most
eloquent and the most persuasive, is assuredly Hazlitt. And, being
something of an expert in talk,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> I think that, if I could break the
grave and call the great ghosts back to earth for a spell of their
mortal fury, I would begin and end with Lamb and Hazlitt: Lamb
as he always was;<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Hazlitt in one of his high and mighty moods,
sweeping life, and letters, and the art of painting, and the nature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>man, and the curious case of woman (especially the curious case of
woman!) into a rapture of give-and-take, a night-long series of
achievements in consummate speech.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>VI</h3>

<p class='c011'>Many men, as Coleridge, have written well, and yet talked better
than they wrote. I have named Coleridge, though his talk, prodigious
as it was, in the long run ended in ‘Om-m-mject’ and
‘Sum-m-mject,’ and though, some enchanting and undying verses
apart, his writing, save when it is merely critical, is nowadays of small
account. But, in truth, I have in my mind, rather, two friends, both
dead, of whom one, an artist in letters, lived to conquer the English-speaking
world, while the second, who should, I think, have been the
greater writer, addicted himself to another art, took to letters late in
life, and, having the largest and the most liberal utterance I have
known, was constrained by the very process of composition so to
produce himself that scarce a touch of his delightful, apprehensive,
all-expressing spirit appeared upon his page. I take these two cases
because both are excessive. In the one you had both speech and
writing; in the other you found a rarer brain, a more fanciful and
daring humour, a richer gusto, perhaps a wider knowledge, in any
event a wider charity. And at one point the two met, and that point
was talk. Therein each was pre-eminent, each irresistible, each a
master after his kind, each endowed with a full measure of those gifts
that qualify the talker’s temperament: as voice and eye and laugh,
look and gesture, humour and fantasy, audacity and agility of mind,
a lively and most impudent invention, a copious vocabulary, a right
gift of foolery, a just, inevitable sense of conversational right and
wrong. Well; one wrote like an angel, the other like poor Poll; and
both so far excelled in talk that I can take it on me to say that they
who know them only in print scarce know them at all. ’Twas thus,
I imagine, with Hazlitt. He wrote the best he could; but I see
many reasons to believe that he was very much more brilliant and
convincing at the Southampton than he is in the most convincing and
the most brilliant of his Essays. He was a full man; he had all the
talker’s gifts; he exulted in all kinds of oral opportunities; what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>more is there to say? Sure ’tis the case of all that are born to talk
as well as write. They live their best in talk, and what they write
is but a sop for posterity: a last dying speech and confession (as it
were) to show that not for nothing were they held rare fellows
in their day.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is not to say that Hazlitt was not an admirable man of
letters. His theories were many, for he was a reality among men,
and so had many interests, and there was none on which he did not
write forcibly, luminously, arrestingly. He had the true sense of
his material, and used the English language as a painter his pigments,
as a musician the varying and abounding tonalities that constitute a
symphonic scheme. His were a beautiful and choice vocabulary, an
excellent ear for cadence, a notable gift of expression. In fact, when
Stevenson was pleased to declare that ‘we are mighty fine fellows,
but we cannot write like William Hazlitt,’ he said no more than the
truth. Whether or not we are mighty fine fellows is a Great
Perhaps; but that none of us, from Stevenson down, can as writers
come near to Hazlitt—this, to me, is merely indubitable. To note
that he now and then writes blank verse is to note that he sometimes
writes impassioned prose;<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> he misquoted habitually; he was a good
hater, and could be monstrous unfair; he was given to thinking twice,
and his second thoughts were not always better than his first; he
repeated himself as seemed good to him. But in the criticism of
politics, the criticism of letters, the criticism of acting, the criticism
and expression of life,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> there is none like him. His politics are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>mine; I think he is ridiculously mistaken when he contrasts the
Wordsworth of the best things in <cite>The Excursion</cite> with the ‘classic
Akenside’; his <cite>Byron</cite> is the merest petulance; his <cite>Burke</cite> (when he
is in a bad temper with Burke), his <cite>Fox</cite>, his <cite>Pitt</cite>, his <cite>Bonaparte</cite>—these
are impossible. Also, I never talk art or life with him but
I disagree. But I go on reading him, all the same; and I find
that technically and spiritually I am always the better for the bout.
Where outside Boswell is there better talk than in Hazlitt’s <cite>Boswell
Redivivus</cite>—his so-called <cite>Conversations with Northcote</cite>? And his
<cite>Age of Elizabeth</cite>, and his <cite>Comic Writers</cite>, and his <cite>Spirit of the Age</cite>—where
else to look for such a feeling for differences, such a sense of
literature, such an instant, such a masterful, whole-hearted interest in
the marking and distinguishing qualities of writers? And <cite>The Plain
Speaker</cite>—is it not at least as good reading as (say) <cite>Virginibus Puerisque</cite>
and the discoursings of the late imperishable Mr. Pater! His
<cite>Political Essays</cite> is readable after—how many years? His notes on
Kean and the Siddons are as novel and convincing as when they
were penned. In truth, he is ever a solace and a refreshment. As
a critic of letters he lacks the intense, immortalising vision,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>even as he lacks, in places, the illuminating and inevitable style of
Lamb. But if he be less savoury, he is also more solid, and he
gives you phrases, conclusions, splendours of insight and expression,
high-piled and golden essays in appreciation: as the <em>Wordsworth</em> and
the <em>Coleridge</em> of the <cite>Political Essays</cite>, the character of Hamlet, the
note on Shakespeare’s style, the <em>Horne Tooke</em>, the <em>Cervantes</em>, the
<em>Rousseau</em>, the <em>Sir Thomas Browne</em>, the <em>Cobbet</em>: that must ever be
rated high among the possessions of the English mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a writer, therefore, it is with Lamb that I would bracket him:
they are dissimilars, but they go gallantly and naturally together—<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">par
nobile fratrum</span></i>.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Give us these two, with some ripe Cobbett, a
volume of Southey, some Wordsworth, certain pages of Shelley, a
great deal of the Byron who wrote letters, and we get the right prose
of the time. The best of it all, perhaps, is the best of Lamb.
But Hazlitt’s, for different qualities, is so imminent and shining a
second that I hesitate as to the pre-eminency. Probably the race is
Lamb’s. But Hazlitt is ever Hazlitt; and at his highest moments
Hazlitt is hard to beat, and has not these many years been beaten.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>EDITORS’ PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Two previous editions of Hazlitt’s works have been published: the
Templeman edition, edited by the author’s son, and the seven volume
edition in Bohn’s Library, edited by the author’s grandson, Mr. W.
Carew Hazlitt. Valuable as these editions are from the exceptional
advantages enjoyed by the respective editors, neither of them professes
to be, or is, complete, and the aim of the present edition is to give for
the first time an accurate text of the complete collected writings of
Hazlitt with the exception of his <cite>Life of Napoleon</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of works published in book form by Hazlitt himself
the latest edition published in his lifetime is here reprinted. Some
obvious errors of the press have been corrected, but no attempt has
been made to modernise or improve Hazlitt’s orthography or
punctuation. He himself expressed contempt for ‘the collating of
points and commas,’ and was probably a careless proof reader. He
did not plume himself, as Boswell did, upon a deliberately adopted
orthography, and his punctuation and use of italics were perhaps
rather his printers’ fancy than his own. However that may be,
the Editors feel that there is no justification for any tampering with
his text. Essays not republished by Hazlitt himself are printed
from the periodical or other publication in which they first appeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been found impossible to avoid a good deal of repetition.
All readers of Hazlitt know that he repeated not only phrases and
sentences, but paragraphs and pages, as, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, in the case of the essay
on ‘The Character of Pitt’ (see note to p. 125). A few of
such cases might have been dealt with by means of cross references,
but they are so numerous that the cross references would have become
tiresome if only one of the identical or nearly identical passages had
been printed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The notes chiefly contain bibliographical matter, concise biographical
details of some of the persons mentioned by Hazlitt, and references
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>to quotations. They also include several passages which Hazlitt
omitted from his essays when he came to republish them in book
form. Some of these are in themselves worthy of preservation;
some help to explain the ferocity of certain contemporary allusions;
and it is at any rate interesting to compare what he rejected with
what he retained in moments of reflection.</p>

<p class='c000'>One word is necessary here as to the course which has been
adopted with Hazlitt’s very numerous and very inaccurate quotations.
In many cases his quotations are simply and unintentionally inaccurate,
but very often he misquotes (if so it can be called) on purpose.
That is to say, in his masterful way he presses quotations into his
service, and if they are not exactly serviceable as they stand, he
makes them so by changing a word here and there, or by blending
two or more quotations together. He sometimes quotes (or misquotes)
without using quotation marks, and the Editors would fain
believe that he sometimes uses quotation marks to round off some
unusually happy phrase of his own. The variations between Hazlitt
and his original are given in the notes where it seemed desirable that
they should be given, but in no case have his quotations been
corrected or altered in the <em>text</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been a pleasure to the Editors to have the sympathy and
co-operation of Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt, and they desire to thank him
for his valuable assistance. At the same time they accept entire
responsibility for the errors and failings which may be found in their
work.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'><cite>The Round Table</cite> was published in two 12mo volumes in 1817. The title-page
runs as follows: ‘The Round Table: A Collection of Essays on Literature,
Men, and Manners, By William Hazlitt. Edinburgh: Printed for Archibald
Constable and Co. And Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, London, 1817.’
Twelve of the fifty-two numbers were by Leigh Hunt, as the Advertisement
explains. The essays consisted for the most part, but not entirely, of papers
contributed to <cite>The Examiner</cite> under the title of ‘The Round Table’ between
January 1, 1815, and January 5, 1817. Hazlitt, however, included several essays
taken from other columns of <cite>The Examiner</cite> and from <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> and
other sources, and did not include the whole of his contributions to the Round
Table series. A ‘third’ edition, edited by the author’s son, was published in one
12mo volume in 1841. In this edition many essays were omitted which had
appeared, or were intended to appear, in the series of Hazlitt’s works then being
published by Templeman; three essays contributed by Hazlitt to <cite>The Liberal</cite> in
1822 were added; and Leigh Hunt’s essays were retained. Hazlitt’s essays as
published in the two volumes of 1817 were restored, and Leigh Hunt’s essays were
for the first time omitted in a later edition (8vo, 1871) edited by the author’s
grandson, Mr. W. C. Hazlitt. The present edition is an exact reproduction of
Hazlitt’s essays from the edition of 1817, except that a few obvious printer’s errors
have been corrected. Of the contributions made by Hazlitt to the Round Table
series in <cite>The Examiner</cite> and not included in the two volumes of 1817 some were
used by him in other publications, <cite>Characters of Shakespear’s Plays</cite> (1817) and <cite>Political
Essays</cite> (1819), some were published in the posthumous <cite>Winterslow</cite> (1850), and
some have not been hitherto republished. The source of each of the following
essays is indicated in the Notes. Gifford’s review of <cite>The Round Table</cite> in <cite>The
Quarterly Review</cite> for April 1817 is dealt with by the author in <cite>A Letter to William
Gifford, Esq.</cite>, which is included in this volume.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE EDITION OF 1817</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The following work falls somewhat short of its title and original
intention. It was proposed by my friend, Mr. Hunt, to publish a
series of papers in the Examiner, in the manner of the early periodical
Essayists, the Spectator and Tatler. These papers were to be contributed
by various persons on a variety of subjects; and Mr. Hunt,
as the Editor, was to take the characteristic or dramatic part of
the work upon himself. I undertook to furnish occasional Essays
and Criticisms; one or two other friends promised their assistance;
but the essence of the work was to be miscellaneous. The next
thing was to fix upon a title for it. After much doubtful consultation,
that of <span class='sc'>The Round Table</span> was agreed upon as most
descriptive of its nature and design. But our plan had been no
sooner arranged and entered upon, than Buonaparte landed at Frejus,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et voila la Table Ronde dissoute<a id='txxxi'></a></span></i>. Our little congress was broken up as
well as the great one; Politics called off the attention of the Editor
from the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Belles Lettres</span></cite>; and the task of continuing the work fell
chiefly upon the person who was least able to give life and spirit to
the original design. A want of variety in the subjects and mode of
treating them, is, perhaps, the least disadvantage resulting from this
circumstance. All the papers, in the two volumes here offered to
the public, were written by myself and Mr. Hunt, except a letter
communicated by a friend in the seventeenth number. Out of the
fifty-two numbers, twelve are Mr. Hunt’s, with the signatures L. H.
or H. T. For all the rest I am answerable.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 1.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON THE LOVE OF LIFE&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Jan. 15, 1815.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It is our intention, in the course of these papers, occasionally to
expose certain vulgar errors, which have crept into our reasonings on
men and manners. Perhaps one of the most interesting of these, is
that which relates to the source of our general attachment to life.
We are not going to enter into the question, whether life is, on the
whole, to be regarded as a blessing, though we are by no means
inclined to adopt the opinion of that sage, who thought ‘that the best
thing that could have happened to a man was never to have been born,
and the next best to have died the moment after he came into existence.’
The common argument, however, which is made use of to
prove the value of life, from the strong desire which almost every one
feels for its continuance, appears to be altogether inconclusive. The
wise and the foolish, the weak and the strong, the lame and the
blind, the prisoner and the free, the prosperous and the wretched, the
beggar and the king, the rich and the poor, the young and the old,
from the little child who tries to leap over his own shadow, to the old
man who stumbles blindfold on his grave, all feel this desire in
common. Our notions with respect to the importance of life, and
our attachment to it, depend on a principle, which has very little to
do with its happiness or its misery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The love of life is, in general, the effect not of our enjoyments,
but of our passions. We are not attached to it so much for its own
sake, or as it is connected with happiness, as because it is necessary
to action. Without life there can be no action—no objects of pursuit—no
restless desires—no tormenting passions. Hence it is that we
fondly cling to it—that we dread its termination as the close, not of
enjoyment, but of hope. The proof that our attachment to life is not
absolutely owing to the immediate satisfaction we find in it, is, that
those persons are commonly found most loth to part with it who have
the least enjoyment of it, and who have the greatest difficulties to
struggle with, as losing gamesters are the most desperate. And
farther, there are not many persons who, with all their pretended love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of life, would not, if it had been in their power, have melted down
the longest life to a few hours. ‘The school-boy,’ says Addison,
‘counts the time till the return of the holidays; the minor longs to be
of age; the lover is impatient till he is married.’—‘Hope and
fantastic expectations spend much of our lives; and while with
passion we look for a coronation, or the death of an enemy, or a day
of joy, passing from fancy to possession without any intermediate
notices, we throw away a precious year’ (Jeremy Taylor). We
would willingly, and without remorse, sacrifice not only the present
moment, but all the interval (no matter how long) that separates us
from any favourite object. We chiefly look upon life, then, as the
means to an end. Its common enjoyments and its daily evils are
alike disregarded for any idle purpose we have in view. It should
seem as if there were a few green sunny spots in the desert of life,
to which we are always hastening forward: we eye them wistfully in
the distance, and care not what perils or suffering we endure, so that
we arrive at them at last. However weary we may be of the same
stale round—however sick of the past—however hopeless of the
future—the mind still revolts at the thought of death, because the
fancied possibility of good, which always remains with life, gathers
strength as it is about to be torn from us for ever, and the dullest
scene looks bright compared with the darkness of the grave. Our
reluctance to part with existence evidently does not depend on the
calm and even current of our lives, but on the force and impulse of
the passions. Hence that indifference to death which has been sometimes
remarked in people who lead a solitary and peaceful life in
remote and barren districts. The pulse of life in them does not beat
strong enough to occasion any violent revulsion of the frame when it
ceases. He who treads the green mountain turf, or he who sleeps
beneath it, enjoys an almost equal quiet. The death of those persons
has always been accounted happy, who had attained their utmost
wishes, who had nothing left to regret or to desire. Our repugnance
to death increases in proportion to our consciousness of having lived
in vain—to the violence of our efforts, and the keenness of our
disappointments—and to our earnest desire to find in the future, if
possible, a rich amends for the past. We may be said to nurse our
existence with the greatest tenderness, according to the pain it has
cost us; and feel at every step of our varying progress the truth of
that line of the poet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘An ounce of sweet is worth a pound of sour.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The love of life is in fact the sum of all our passions and of all our
enjoyments; but these are by no means the same thing, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>vehemence of our passions is irritated, not less by disappointment than
by the prospect of success. Nothing seems to be a match for this
general tenaciousness of existence, but such an extremity either of
bodily or mental suffering as destroys at once the power both of habit
and imagination. In short, the question, whether life is accompanied
with a greater quantity of pleasure or pain, may be fairly set aside
as frivolous, and of no practical utility; for our attachment to life
depends on our interest in it; and it cannot be denied that we have
more interest in this moving, busy scene, agitated with a thousand
hopes and fears, and checkered with every diversity of joy and
sorrow, than in a dreary blank. To be something is better than to
be nothing, because we can feel no interest in <em>nothing</em>. Passion,
imagination, self-will, the sense of power, the very consciousness of
our existence, bind us to life, and hold us fast in its chains, as by
a magic spell, in spite of every other consideration. Nothing can
be more philosophical than the reasoning which Milton puts into the
mouth of the fallen angel:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And that must end us, that must be our cure,</div>
      <div class='line'>To be no more; Sad cure: For who would lose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though full of pain, this intellectual being,</div>
      <div class='line'>Those thoughts that wander through eternity,</div>
      <div class='line'>To perish rather, swallow’d up and lost</div>
      <div class='line'>In the wide womb of uncreated night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Devoid of sense and motion?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nearly the same account may be given in answer to the question
which has been asked, <em>Why so few tyrants kill themselves?</em> In the
first place, they are never satisfied with the mischief they have done,
and cannot quit their hold of power, after all sense of pleasure is fled.
Besides, they absurdly argue from the means of happiness placed
within their reach to the end itself; and, dazzled by the pomp and
pageantry of a throne, cannot relinquish the persuasion that they <em>ought</em>
to be happier than other men. The prejudice of opinion, which
attaches us to life, is in them stronger than in others, and incorrigible
to experience. The Great are life’s fools—dupes of the splendid
shadows that surround them, and wedded to the very mockeries of
opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever is our situation or pursuit in life, the result will be much
the same. The strength of the passion seldom corresponds to the
pleasure we find in its indulgence. The miser ‘robs himself to increase
his store’; the ambitious man toils up a slippery precipice only
to be tumbled headlong from its height: the lover is infatuated with
the charms of his mistress, exactly in proportion to the mortifications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>he has received from her. Even those who succeed in nothing, who,
as it has been emphatically expressed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Are made desperate by too quick a sense</div>
      <div class='line'>Of constant infelicity; cut off</div>
      <div class='line'>From peace like exiles, on some barren rock,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their life’s sad prison, with no more of ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than sentinels between two armies set’;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>are yet as unwilling as others to give over the unprofitable strife:
their harassed feverish existence refuses rest, and frets the languor of
exhausted hope into the torture of unavailing regret. The exile, who
has been unexpectedly restored to his country and to liberty, often
finds his courage fail with the accomplishment of all his wishes, and
the struggle of life and hope ceases at the same instant.</p>

<p class='c000'>We once more repeat, that we do not, in the foregoing remarks,
mean to enter into a comparative estimate of the value of human life,
but merely to shew that the strength of our attachment to it is a very
fallacious test of its happiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The study of the Classics is less to be regarded as an exercise of the
intellect, than as ‘a discipline of humanity.’ The peculiar advantage
of this mode of education consists not so much in strengthening the
understanding, as in softening and refining the taste. It gives men
liberal views; it accustoms the mind to take an interest in things
foreign to itself; to love virtue for its own sake; to prefer fame to
life, and glory to riches; and to fix our thoughts on the remote and
permanent, instead of narrow and fleeting objects. It teaches us to
believe that there is something really great and excellent in the world,
surviving all the shocks of accident and fluctuations of opinion, and
raises us above that low and servile fear, which bows only to present
power and upstart authority. Rome and Athens filled a place in the
history of mankind, which can never be occupied again. They were
two cities set on a hill, which could not be hid; all eyes have seen
them, and their light shines like a mighty sea-mark into the abyss
of time.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Still green with bays each ancient altar stands,</div>
      <div class='line'>Above the reach of sacrilegious hands;</div>
      <div class='line'>Secure from flames, from envy’s fiercer rage,</div>
      <div class='line'>Destructive war, and all-involving age.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Hail, bards triumphant, born in happier days,</div>
      <div class='line'>Immortal heirs of universal praise!</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose honours with increase of ages grow,</div>
      <div class='line'>As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is this feeling, more than anything else, which produces a
marked difference between the study of the ancient and modern
languages, and which, from the weight and importance of the consequences
attached to the former, stamps every word with a monumental
firmness. By conversing with the <em>mighty dead</em>, we imbibe
sentiment with knowledge; we become strongly attached to those
who can no longer either hurt or serve us, except through the influence
which they exert over the mind. We feel the presence of that power
which gives immortality to human thoughts and actions, and catch
the flame of enthusiasm from all nations and ages.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is hard to find in minds otherwise formed, either a real love of
excellence, or a belief that any excellence exists superior to their own.
Everything is brought down to the vulgar level of their own ideas
and pursuits. Persons without education certainly do not want either
acuteness or strength of mind in what concerns themselves, or in
things immediately within their observation; but they have no power
of abstraction, no general standard of taste, or scale of opinion. They
see their objects always near, and never in the horizon. Hence arises
that egotism which has been remarked as the characteristic of self-taught
men, and which degenerates into obstinate prejudice or petulant
fickleness of opinion, according to the natural sluggishness or activity
of their minds. For they either become blindly bigoted to the first
opinions they have struck out for themselves, and inaccessible to conviction;
or else (the dupes of their own vanity and shrewdness) are
everlasting converts to every crude suggestion that presents itself, and
the last opinion is always the true one. Each successive discovery
flashes upon them with equal light and evidence, and every new fact
overturns their whole system. It is among this class of persons,
whose ideas never extend beyond the feeling of the moment, that we
find partizans, who are very honest men, with a total want of principle,
and who unite the most hardened effrontery, and intolerance of opinion,
to endless inconsistency and self-contradiction.</p>

<p class='c000'>A celebrated political writer of the present day, who is a great
enemy to classical education, is a remarkable instance both of what
can and what cannot be done without it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been attempted of late to set up a distinction between the
education <em>of words</em>, and the education <em>of things</em>, and to give the
preference in all cases to the latter. But, in the first place, the knowledge
of things, or of the realities of life, is not easily to be taught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>except by things themselves, and, even if it were, is not so absolutely
indispensable as it has been supposed. ‘The world is too much with
us, early and late’; and the fine dream of our youth is best prolonged
among the visionary objects of antiquity. We owe many of our most
amiable delusions, and some of our superiority, to the grossness of
mere physical existence, to the strength of our associations with
words. Language, if it throws a veil over our ideas, adds a softness
and refinement to them, like that which the atmosphere gives to
naked objects. There can be no true elegance without taste in style.
In the next place, we mean absolutely to deny the application of the
principle of utility to the present question. By an obvious transposition
of ideas, some persons have confounded a knowledge of useful
things with useful knowledge. Knowledge is only useful in itself,
as it exercises or gives pleasure to the mind: the only knowledge that
is of use in a practical sense, is professional knowledge. But knowledge,
considered as a branch of general education, can be of use only
to the mind of the person acquiring it. If the knowledge of language
produces pedants, the other kind of knowledge (which is proposed
to be substituted for it) can only produce quacks. There is no
question, but that the knowledge of astronomy, of chemistry, and of
agriculture, is highly useful to the world, and absolutely necessary to
be acquired by persons carrying on certain professions: but the
practical utility of a knowledge of these subjects ends there. For
example, it is of the utmost importance to the navigator to know
exactly in what degree of longitude and latitude such a rock lies:
but to us, sitting here about our Round Table, it is not of the smallest
consequence whatever, whether the map-maker has placed it an inch
to the right or to the left; we are in no danger of running against it.
So the art of making shoes is a highly useful art, and very proper to
be known and practised by some body: that is, by the shoemaker.
But to pretend that every one else should be thoroughly acquainted
with the whole process of this ingenious handicraft, as one branch of
useful knowledge, would be preposterous. It is sometimes asked,
What is the use of poetry? and we have heard the argument carried
on almost like a parody on <em>Falstaff’s</em> reasoning about Honour. ‘Can
it set a leg? No. Or an arm? No. Or take away the grief of a
wound? No. Poetry hath no skill in surgery then? No.’ It is
likely that the most enthusiastic lover of poetry would so far agree to
the truth of this statement, that if he had just broken a leg, he would
send for a surgeon, instead of a volume of poems from a library. But,
‘they that are whole need not a physician.’ The reasoning would
be well founded, if we lived in an hospital, and not in the world.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 3.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON THE TATLER&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>March 5, 1815.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Of all the periodical Essayists, (our ingenious predecessors), the
<cite>Tatler</cite> has always appeared to us the most accomplished and agreeable.
Montaigne, who was the father of this kind of personal
authorship among the moderns, in which the reader is admitted
behind the curtain, and sits down with the writer in his gown and
slippers, was a most magnanimous and undisguised egotist; but
Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq. was the more disinterested gossip of the two.
The French author is contented to describe the peculiarities of his
own mind and person, which he does with a most copious and
unsparing hand. The English journalist, good-naturedly, lets you
into the secret both of his own affairs and those of his neighbours.
A young lady, on the other side of Temple Bar, cannot be seen at
her glass for half a day together, but Mr. Bickerstaff takes due
notice of it; and he has the first intelligence of the symptoms of the
<em>belle</em> passion appearing in any young gentleman at the west end of the
town. The departures and arrivals of widows with handsome jointures,
either to bury their grief in the country, or to procure a second
husband in town, are regularly recorded in his pages. He is well
acquainted with the celebrated beauties of the last age at the Court
of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> and the old gentleman often grows romantic in
recounting the disastrous strokes which his youth suffered from the
glances of their bright eyes and their unaccountable caprices. In
particular, he dwells with a secret satisfaction on one of his mistresses
who left him for a rival, and whose constant reproach to her husband,
on occasion of any quarrel between them, was,—‘I, that might have
married the famous Mr. Bickerstaff, to be treated in this manner!’
The club at the <em>Trumpet</em> consists of a set of persons as entertaining as
himself. The cavalcade of the justice of the peace, the knight of the
shire, the country squire, and the young gentleman, his nephew, who
waited on him at his chambers, in such form and ceremony, seem not
to have settled the order of their precedence to this hour; and we
should hope the Upholsterer and his companions in the Green Park
stand as fair a chance for immortality as some modern politicians.
Mr. Bickerstaff himself is a gentleman and a scholar, a humourist
and a man of the world; with a great deal of nice easy <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> about
him. If he walks out and is caught in a shower of rain, he makes
us amends for this unlucky accident, by a criticism on the shower in
Virgil, and concludes with a burlesque copy of verses on a city-shower.
He entertains us, when he dates from his own apartment, with
a quotation from Plutarch or a moral reflection; from the Grecian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>coffeehouse with politics; and from Will’s or the Temple with the
poets and players, the beaux and men of wit and pleasure about town.
In reading the pages of the <cite>Tatler</cite>, we seem as if suddenly transported to
the age of Queen Anne, of toupees and full-bottomed periwigs. The
whole appearance of our dress and manners undergoes a delightful
metamorphosis. We are surprised with the rustling of hoops and the
glittering of paste buckles. The beaux and the belles are of a quite
different species; we distinguish the dappers, the smarts, and the
pretty fellows, as they pass; we are introduced to Betterton and Mrs.
Oldfield behind the scenes; are made familiar with the persons of
Mr. Penkethman and Mr. Bullock; we listen to a dispute at a
tavern on the merits of the Duke of Marlborough or Marshal
Turenne; or are present at the first rehearsal of a play by Vanbrugh,
or the reading of a new poem by Mr. Pope.—The privilege of thus
virtually transporting ourselves to past times, is even greater than that
of visiting distant places. London, a hundred years ago, would be
better worth seeing than Paris at the present moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be said that all this is to be found, in the same or a greater
degree, in the <cite>Spectator</cite>. We do not think so; or, at least, there is
in the last work a much greater proportion of common-place matter.
We have always preferred the <cite>Tatler</cite> to the <cite>Spectator</cite>. Whether it is
owing to our having been earlier or better acquainted with the one
than the other, our pleasure in reading the two works is not at all in
proportion to their comparative reputation. The <cite>Tatler</cite> contains only
half the number of volumes, and we will venture to say, at least an
equal quantity of sterling wit and sense. ‘The first sprightly runnings’
are there: it has more of the original spirit, more of the freshness and
stamp of nature. The indications of character and strokes of humour
are more true and frequent, the reflections that suggest themselves
arise more from the occasion, and are less spun out into regular dissertations.
They are more like the remarks which occur in sensible
conversation, and less like a lecture. Something is left to the understanding
of the reader. Steele seems to have gone into his closet
only to set down what he observed out-of-doors; Addison seems to
have spun out and wire-drawn the hints, which he borrowed from
Steele, or took from nature, to the utmost. We do not mean to
depreciate Addison’s talents, but we wish to do justice to Steele,
who was, upon the whole, a less artificial and more original writer.
The descriptions of Steele resemble loose sketches or fragments of a
comedy; those of Addison are ingenious paraphrases on the genuine
text. The characters of the club, not only in the <cite>Tatler</cite>, but in the
<cite>Spectator</cite>, were drawn by Steele. That of Sir Roger de Coverley is
among them. Addison has gained himself eternal honour by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>manner of filling up this last character. Those of Will Wimble and
Will Honeycomb are not a whit behind it in delicacy and felicity.
Many of the most exquisite pieces in the <cite>Tatler</cite> are also Addison’s,
as the Court of Honour, and the Personification of Musical
Instruments. We do not know whether the picture of the family of
an old acquaintance, in which the children run to let Mr. Bickerstaff
in at the door, and the one that loses the race that way turns back to
tell the father that he is come,—with the nice gradation of incredulity
in the little boy, who is got into <cite>Guy of Warwick</cite> and <cite>The Seven
Champions</cite>, and who shakes his head at the veracity of <cite>Æsop’s Fables</cite>,—is
Steele’s or Addison’s.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> The account of the two sisters, one of whom
held her head up higher than ordinary, from having on a pair of flowered
garters, and of the married lady who complained to the <cite>Tatler</cite> of the
neglect of her husband, are unquestionably Steele’s. If the <cite>Tatler</cite> is
not inferior to the <cite>Spectator</cite> in manners and character, it is very
superior to it in the interest of many of the stories. Several of
the incidents related by Steele have never been surpassed in the heart-rending
pathos of private distress. We might refer to those of the lover
and his mistress when the theatre caught fire, of the bridegroom who,
by accident, kills his bride on the day of their marriage, the story of
Mr. Eustace and his wife, and the fine dream about his own mistress
when a youth. What has given its superior popularity to the
<cite>Spectator</cite>, is the greater gravity of its pretensions, its moral dissertations
and critical reasonings, by which we confess we are less edified than
by other things. Systems and opinions change, but nature is always
true. It is the extremely moral and didactic tone of the <cite>Spectator</cite>
which makes us apt to think of Addison (according to Mandeville’s
sarcasm) as ‘a parson in a tie-wig.’ Some of the moral essays are,
however, exquisitely beautiful and happy. Such are the reflections in
Westminster Abbey, on the Royal Exchange, and some very affecting
ones on the death of a young lady. These, it must be allowed,
are the perfection of elegant sermonising. His critical essays we do
not think quite so good. We prefer Steele’s occasional selection of
beautiful poetical passages, without any affectation of analysing their
beauties, to Addison’s fine-spun theories. The best criticism in the
<cite>Spectator</cite>, that on the <cite>Cartoons</cite> of Raphael, is by Steele. We owed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>this acknowledgment to a writer who has so often put us in good
humour with ourselves and every thing about us, when few things
else could.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The question which has often been asked, <em>Why there are so few
good modern Comedies?</em> appears in a great measure to answer itself.
It is because so many excellent Comedies have been written, that there
are none written at present. Comedy naturally wears itself out—destroys
the very food on which it lives; and by constantly and
successfully exposing the follies and weaknesses of mankind to ridicule,
in the end leaves itself nothing worth laughing at. It holds the mirror
up to nature; and men, seeing their most striking peculiarities and
defects pass in gay review before them, learn either to avoid or conceal
them. It is not the criticism which the public taste exercises
upon the stage, but the criticism which the stage exercises upon
public manners, that is fatal to comedy, by rendering the subject-matter
of it tame, correct, and spiritless. We are drilled into a sort of
stupid decorum, and forced to wear the same dull uniform of outward
appearance; and yet it is asked, why the Comic Muse does not point,
as she was wont, at the peculiarities of our gait and gesture, and
exhibit the picturesque contrast of our dress and costume, in all that
graceful variety in which she delights. The genuine source of comic
writing,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Where it must live, or have no life at all,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>is undoubtedly to be found in the distinguishing peculiarities of men
and manners. Now, this distinction can subsist, so as to be strong,
pointed, and general, only while the manners of different classes are
formed immediately by their particular circumstances, and the
characters of individuals by their natural temperament and situation,
without being everlastingly modified and neutralised by intercourse
with the world—by knowledge and education. In a certain stage of
society, men may be said to vegetate like trees, and to become rooted
to the soil in which they grow. They have no idea of anything
beyond themselves and their immediate sphere of action; they are, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>it were, circumscribed, and defined by their particular circumstances;
they are what their situation makes them, and nothing more. Each
is absorbed in his own profession or pursuit, and each in his turn
contracts that habitual peculiarity of manners and opinions, which
makes him the subject of ridicule to others, and the sport of the Comic
Muse. Thus the physician is nothing but a physician, the lawyer is a
mere lawyer, the scholar degenerates into a pedant, the country squire
is a different species of being from the fine gentleman, the citizen and
the courtier inhabit a different world, and even the affectation of
certain characters, in aping the follies or vices of their betters, only
serves to show the immeasurable distance which custom or fortune has
placed between them. Hence the early comic writers, taking advantage
of this mixed and solid mass of ignorance, folly, pride, and
prejudice, made those deep and lasting incisions into it,—have given
those sharp and nice touches, that bold relief to their characters,—have
opposed them in every variety of contrast and collision, of conscious
self-satisfaction and mutual antipathy, with a power which can only
find full scope in the same rich and inexhaustible materials. But in
proportion as comic genius succeeds in taking off the mask from
ignorance and conceit, as it teaches us to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘See ourselves as others see us,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>in proportion as we are brought out on the stage together, and our
prejudices clash one against the other, our sharp angular points wear
off; we are no longer rigid in absurdity, passionate in folly, and we
prevent the ridicule directed at our habitual foibles, by laughing at them
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it be said, that there is the same fund of absurdity and prejudice
in the world as ever—that there are the same unaccountable perversities
lurking at the bottom of every breast,—I should answer, be it
so: but at least we keep our follies to ourselves as much as possible—we
palliate, shuffle, and equivocate with them—they sneak into by-corners,
and do not, like <em>Chaucer’s Canterbury Pilgrims</em>, march along
the highroad, and form a procession—they do not entrench themselves
strongly behind custom and precedent—they are not embodied in professions
and ranks in life—they are not organised into a system—they
do not openly resort to a standard, but are a sort of straggling nondescripts,
that, like <em>Wart</em>, ‘present no mark to the foeman.’ As to the
gross and palpable absurdities of modern manners, they are too shallow
and barefaced, and those who affect, are too little <em>serious</em> in them, to
make them worth the detection of the Comic Muse. They proceed
from an idle, impudent affectation of folly in general, in the dashing
<em>bravura</em> style, not from an infatuation with any of its characteristic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>modes. In short, the proper object of ridicule is <em>egotism</em>; and a man
cannot be a very great egotist who every day sees himself represented
on the stage. We are deficient in Comedy, because we are without
characters in real life—as we have no historical pictures, because we
have no faces proper for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is, indeed, the evident tendency of all literature to generalise
and <em>dissipate</em> character, by giving men the same artificial education,
and the same common stock of ideas; so that we see all objects from
the same point of view, and through the same reflected medium;—we
learn to exist, not in ourselves, but in books;—all men become alike
mere readers—spectators, not actors in the scene, and lose all proper
personal identity. The templar, the wit, the man of pleasure, and
the man of fashion, the courtier and the citizen, the knight and the

exchanged common-places on the barren plains of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute littérature</span></i>—toil
slowly on to the Temple of Science, seen a long way off upon
a level, and end in one dull compound of politics, criticism, chemistry,
and metaphysics!</p>

<p class='c000'>We cannot expect to reconcile opposite things. If, for example,
any of us were to put ourselves into the stage-coach from Salisbury
to London, it is more than probable we should not meet with the
same number of odd accidents, or ludicrous distresses on the road,
that befell <em>Parson Adams</em>; but why, if we get into a common
vehicle, and submit to the conveniences of modern travelling, should
we complain of the want of adventures? Modern manners may be
compared to a modern stage-coach: our limbs may be a little cramped
with the confinement, and we may grow drowsy; but we arrive safe,
without any very amusing or very sad accident, at our journey’s end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, the alterations which have taken place in conversation and
dress in the same period, have been by no means favourable to Comedy.
The present prevailing style of conversation is not <em>personal</em>, but critical
and analytical. It consists almost entirely in the discussion of general
topics, in dissertations on philosophy or taste: and Congreve would
be able to derive no better hints from the conversations of our toilettes
or drawing-rooms, for the exquisite raillery or poignant repartee of his
dialogues, than from a deliberation of the Royal Society. In the
same manner, the extreme simplicity and graceful uniformity of
modern dress, however favourable to the arts, has certainly stript
Comedy of one of its richest ornaments and most expressive symbols.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The sweeping pall and buskin, and nodding plume, were never more
serviceable to Tragedy, than the enormous hoops and stiff stays worn
by the belles of former days were to the intrigues of Comedy. They
assisted wonderfully in heightening the mysteries of the passion, and
adding to the intricacy of the plot. Wycherley and Vanbrugh could
not have spared the dresses of Vandyke. These strange fancy-dresses,
perverse disguises, and counterfeit shapes, gave an agreeable
scope to the imagination. ‘That sevenfold fence’ was a sort of foil
to the lusciousness of the dialogue, and a barrier against the sly
encroachments of <em>double entendre</em>. The greedy eye and bold hand
of indiscretion were repressed, which gave a greater licence to the
tongue. The senses were not to be gratified in an instant. Love
was entangled in the folds of the swelling handkerchief, and the
desires might wander for ever round the circumference of a quilted
petticoat, or find a rich lodging in the flowers of a damask stomacher.
There was room for years of patient contrivance, for a thousand
thoughts, schemes, conjectures, hopes, fears, and wishes. There
seemed no end of difficulties and delays; to overcome so many
obstacles was the work of ages. A mistress was an angel concealed
behind whalebone, flounces, and brocade. What an undertaking to
penetrate through the disguise! What an impulse must it give to
the blood, what a keenness to the invention, what a volubility to the
tongue! ‘Mr. Smirk, you are a brisk man,’ was then the most
significant commendation. But now-a-days—a woman can be <em>but
undressed</em>!</p>

<p class='c000'>The same account might be extended to Tragedy. Aristotle has
long since said, that Tragedy purifies the mind by terror and pity;
that is, substitutes an artificial and intellectual interest for real passion.
Tragedy, like Comedy, must therefore defeat itself; for its patterns
must be drawn from the living models within the breast, from feeling
or from observation; and the materials of Tragedy cannot be found
among a people, who are the habitual spectators of Tragedy, whose
interests and passions are not their own, but ideal, remote, sentimental,
and abstracted. It is for this reason chiefly, we conceive,
that the highest efforts of the Tragic Muse are in general the earliest;
where the strong impulses of nature are not lost in the refinements
and glosses of art; where the writers themselves, and those whom
they saw about them, had ‘warm hearts of flesh and blood beating
in their bosoms, and were not embowelled of their natural entrails,
and stuffed with paltry blurred sheets of paper.’ Shakspeare, with
all his genius, could not have written as he did, if he had lived in
the present times. Nature would not have presented itself to him
in the same freshness and vigour; he must have seen it through all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the refractions of successive dullness, and his powers would have
languished in the dense atmosphere of logic and criticism. ‘Men’s
minds,’ he somewhere says, ‘are parcel of their fortunes’; and his
age was necessary to him. It was this which enabled him to grapple
at once with Nature, and which stamped his characters with her
image and superscription.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 5.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON MR. KEAN’S IAGO&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>July 24, 1814.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>We certainly think Mr. Kean’s performance of the part of Iago one
of the most extraordinary exhibitions on the stage. There is no
one within our remembrance who has so completely foiled the critics
as this celebrated actor: one sagacious person imagines that he
must perform a part in a certain manner,—another virtuoso chalks out
a different path for him; and when the time comes, he does the
whole off in a way that neither of them had the least conception of,
and which both of them are therefore very ready to condemn as
entirely wrong. It was ever the trick of genius to be thus. We
confess that Mr. Kean has thrown us out more than once. For
instance, we are very much inclined to adopt the opinion of a contemporary
critic, that his <cite>Richard</cite> is not gay enough, and that his
<cite>Iago</cite> is not grave enough. This he may perhaps conceive to be the
mere caprice of idle criticism; but we will try to give our reasons,
and shall leave them to Mr. Kean’s better judgment. It is to
be remembered, then, that <em>Richard</em> was a princely villain, borne
along in a sort of triumphal car of royal state, buoyed up with the
hopes and privileges of his birth, reposing even on the sanctity of
religion, trampling on his devoted victims without remorse, and who
looked out and laughed from the high watch-tower of his confidence
and his expectations on the desolation and misery he had caused
around him. He held on his way, unquestioned, ‘hedged in with
the divinity of kings,’ amenable to no tribunal, and abusing his power
<em>in contempt of mankind</em>. But as for <em>Iago</em>, we conceive differently of
him. He had not the same natural advantages. He was a mere
adventurer in mischief, a pains-taking plodding knave, without patent
or pedigree, who was obliged to work his up-hill way by wit, not by
will, and to be the founder of his own fortune. He was, if we may
be allowed a vulgar allusion, a sort of prototype of modern Jacobinism,
who thought that talents ought to decide the place,—a man of ‘morbid
sensibility,’ (in the fashionable phrase), full of distrust, of hatred, of
anxious and corroding thoughts, and who, though he might assume
a temporary superiority over others by superior adroitness, and pride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>himself in his skill, could not be supposed to assume it as a matter
of course, as if he had been entitled to it from his birth. We do not
here mean to enter into the characters of the two men, but something
must be allowed to the difference of their situations. There might
be the same insensibility in both as to the end in view, but there could
not well be the same security as to the success of the means. <em>Iago</em>
had to pass through a different ordeal: he had no appliances and
means to boot; no royal road to the completion of his tragedy. His
pretensions were not backed by authority; they were not baptized at
the font; they were not holy-waterproof. He had the whole to
answer for in his own person, and could not shift the responsibility
to the heads of others. Mr. Kean’s <cite>Richard</cite> was, therefore, we
think, deficient in something of that regal jollity and reeling triumph
of success which the part would bear; but this we can easily account
for, because it is the traditional commonplace idea of the character,
that he is to ‘play the dog—to bite and snarl.’—The extreme unconcern
and laboured levity of his <cite>Iago</cite>, on the contrary, is a
refinement and original device of the actor’s own mind, and therefore
deserves consideration. The character of <em>Iago</em>, in fact, belongs to
a class of characters common to Shakspeare, and at the same time
peculiar to him—namely, that of great intellectual activity, accompanied
with a total want of moral principle, and therefore displaying
itself at the constant expence of others, making use of reason as a
pander to will—employing its ingenuity and its resources to palliate
its own crimes and aggravate the faults of others, and seeking to
confound the practical distinctions of right and wrong, by referring
them to some overstrained standard of speculative refinement.—Some
persons, more nice than wise, have thought the whole of the character
of <em>Iago</em> unnatural. Shakspeare, who was quite as good a philosopher
as he was a poet, thought otherwise. He knew that the love of
power, which is another name for the love of mischief, was natural
to man. He would know this as well or better than if it had been
demonstrated to him by a logical diagram, merely from seeing children
paddle in the dirt, or kill flies for sport. We might ask those who
think the character of <em>Iago</em> not natural, why they go to see it performed,
but from the interest it excites, the sharper edge which it
sets on their curiosity and imagination? Why do we go to see
tragedies in general? Why do we always read the accounts in the
newspapers of dreadful fires and shocking murders, but for the same
reason? Why do so many persons frequent executions and trials,
or why do the lower classes almost universally take delight in barbarous
sports and cruelty to animals, but because there is a natural
tendency in the mind to strong excitement, a desire to have its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>faculties roused and stimulated to the utmost? Whenever this
principle is not under the restraint of humanity, or the sense of moral
obligation, there are no excesses to which it will not of itself give
rise, without the assistance of any other motive, either of passion or
self-interest. <em>Iago</em> is only an extreme instance of the kind; that is,
of diseased intellectual activity, with an almost perfect indifference
to moral good or evil, or rather with a preference of the latter,
because it falls more in with his favourite propensity, gives greater
zest to his thoughts, and scope to his actions.—Be it observed, too,
(for the sake of those who are for squaring all human actions by
the maxims of Rochefoucault), that he is quite or nearly as indifferent
to his own fate as to that of others; that he runs all risks for a
trifling and doubtful advantage; and is himself the dupe and victim
of his ruling passion—an incorrigible love of mischief—an insatiable
craving after action of the most difficult and dangerous kind. Our
‘Ancient’ is a philosopher, who fancies that a lie that kills has more
point in it than an alliteration or an antithesis; who thinks a fatal
experiment on the peace of a family a better thing than watching the
palpitations in the heart of a flea in an air-pump; who plots the ruin
of his friends as an exercise for his understanding, and stabs men in
the dark to prevent <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>. Now this, though it be sport, yet it is
dreadful sport. There is no room for trifling and indifference, nor
scarcely for the appearance of it; the very object of his whole plot
is to keep his faculties stretched on the rack, in a state of watch and
ward, in a sort of breathless suspense, without a moment’s interval
of repose. He has a desperate stake to play for, like a man who
fences with poisoned weapons, and has business enough on his hands
to call for the whole stock of his sober circumspection, his dark
duplicity, and insidious gravity. He resembles a man who sits down
to play at chess, for the sake of the difficulty and complication of the
game, and who immediately becomes absorbed in it. His amusements,
if they are amusements, are severe and saturnine—even his wit
blisters. His gaiety arises from the success of his treachery; his
ease from the sense of the torture he has inflicted on others. Even,
if other circumstances permitted it, the part he has to play with
<cite>Othello</cite> requires that he should assume the most serious concern, and
something of the plausibility of a confessor. ‘His cue is villainous
melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o’ Bedlam.’ He is repeatedly
called ‘honest <em>Iago</em>,’ which looks as if there were something suspicious
in his appearance, which admitted a different construction. The tone
which he adopts in the scenes with <em>Roderigo</em>, <em>Desdemona</em>, and <em>Cassio</em>,
is only a relaxation from the more arduous business of the play. Yet
there is in all his conversation an inveterate misanthropy, a licentious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>keenness of perception, which is always sagacious of evil, and snuffs
up the tainted scent of its quarry with rancorous delight. An
exuberance of spleen is the essence of the character. The view
which we have here taken of the subject (if at all correct) will not
therefore justify the extreme alteration which Mr. Kean has introduced
into the part. Actors in general have been struck only with
the wickedness of the character, and have exhibited an assassin going
to the place of execution. Mr. Kean has abstracted the wit of the
character, and makes <em>Iago</em> appear throughout an excellent good fellow,
and lively bottle-companion. But though we do not wish him to be
represented as a monster, or fiend, we see no reason why he should
instantly be converted into a pattern of comic gaiety and good-humour.
The light which illumines the character should rather resemble the
flashes of lightning in the mirky sky, which make the darkness more
terrible. Mr. Kean’s <cite>Iago</cite> is, we suspect, too much in the sun. His
manner of acting the part would have suited better with the character
of <em>Edmund</em> in <cite>King Lear</cite>, who, though in other respects much the
same, has a spice of gallantry in his constitution, and has the favour
and countenance of the ladies, which always gives a man the smug
appearance of a bridegroom!</p>

    <div>TO THE EDITOR OF THE ROUND TABLE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I do not know that any one has ever explained satisfactorily
the true source of our attachment to natural objects, or of that soothing
emotion which the sight of the country hardly ever fails to infuse
into the mind. Some persons have ascribed this feeling to the natural
beauty of the objects themselves, others to the freedom from care,
the silence and tranquillity which scenes of retirement afford—others
to the healthy and innocent employments of a country life—others to
the simplicity of country manners—and others to different causes;
but none to the right one. All these causes may, I believe, have a
share in producing this feeling; but there is another more general
principle, which has been left untouched, and which I shall here
explain, endeavouring to be as little sentimental as the subject will
admit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rousseau, in his Confessions, (the most valuable of all his works),
relates, that when he took possession of his room at Annecy, at the
house of his beloved mistress and friend, he found that he could see ‘a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>little spot of green’ from his window, which endeared his situation
the more to him, because, he says, it was the first time he had had
this object constantly before him since he left Boissy, the place where
he was at school when a child.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Some such feeling as that here
described will be found lurking at the bottom of all our attachments of
this sort. Were it not for the recollections habitually associated with
them, natural objects could not interest the mind in the manner they
do. No doubt, the sky is beautiful; the clouds sail majestically along
its bosom; the sun is cheering; there is something exquisitely graceful
in the manner in which a plant or tree puts forth its branches; the
motion with which they bend and tremble in the evening breeze is
soft and lovely; there is music in the babbling of a brook; the view
from the top of a mountain is full of grandeur; nor can we behold
the ocean with indifference. Or, as the Minstrel sweetly sings—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh how can’st thou renounce the boundless store</div>
      <div class='line'>Of charms which Nature to her votary yields!</div>
      <div class='line'>The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;</div>
      <div class='line'>All that the genial ray of morning gilds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all that echoes to the song of even,</div>
      <div class='line'>All that the mountain’s sheltering bosom shields,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the dread magnificence of heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh how can’st thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not, however, the beautiful and magnificent alone that
we admire in Nature; the most insignificant and rudest objects are
often found connected with the strongest emotions; we become
attached to the most common and familiar images as to the face of a
friend whom we have long known, and from whom we have received
many benefits. It is because natural objects have been associated
with the sports of our childhood, with air and exercise, with our
feelings in solitude, when the mind takes the strongest hold of things,
and clings with the fondest interest to whatever strikes its attention;
with change of place, the pursuit of new scenes, and thoughts of
distant friends: it is because they have surrounded us in almost all
situations, in joy and in sorrow, in pleasure and in pain; because they
have been one chief source and nourishment of our feelings, and a
part of our being, that we love them as we do ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is, generally speaking, the same foundation for our love of
Nature as for all our habitual attachments, namely, association of
ideas. But this is not all. That which distinguishes this attachment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>from others is the transferable nature of our feelings with respect to
physical objects; the associations connected with any one object
extending to the whole class. My having been attached to any particular
person does not make me feel the same attachment to the next
person I may chance to meet; but, if I have once associated strong
feelings of delight with the objects of natural scenery, the tie becomes
indissoluble, and I shall ever after feel the same attachment to other
objects of the same sort. I remember when I was abroad, the trees,
and grass, and wet leaves, rustling in the walks of the Thuilleries, seemed
to be as much English, to be as much the same trees and grass, that I
had always been used to, as the sun shining over my head was the
same sun which I saw in England; the faces only were foreign to
me. Whence comes this difference? It arises from our always
imperceptibly connecting the idea of the individual with man, and only
the idea of the class with natural objects. In the one case, the
external appearance or physical structure is the least thing to be
attended to; in the other, it is every thing. The springs that move
the human form, and make it friendly or adverse to me, lie hid within
it. There is an infinity of motives, passions, and ideas contained in
that narrow compass, of which I know nothing, and in which I have
no share. Each individual is a world to himself, governed by a
thousand contradictory and wayward impulses. I can, therefore,
make no inference from one individual to another; nor can my habitual
sentiments, with respect to any individual, extend beyond himself to
others. But it is otherwise with respect to Nature. There is neither
hypocrisy, caprice, nor mental reservation in her favours. Our intercourse
with her is not liable to accident or change, interruption or
disappointment. She smiles on us still the same. Thus, to give an
obvious instance, if I have once enjoyed the cool shade of a tree, and
been lulled into a deep repose by the sound of a brook running at its
feet, I am sure that wherever I can find a tree and a brook, I can
enjoy the same pleasure again. Hence, when I imagine these objects,
I can easily form a mystic personification of the friendly power that
inhabits them, Dryad or Naiad, offering its cool fountain or its tempting
shade. Hence the origin of the Grecian mythology. All
objects of the same kind being the same, not only in their appearance,
but in their practical uses, we habitually confound them together under
the same general idea; and, whatever fondness we may have conceived
for one, is immediately placed to the common account. The most
opposite kinds and remote trains of feeling gradually go to enrich the
same sentiment; and in our love of Nature, there is all the force of
individual attachment, combined with the most airy abstraction. It is
this circumstance which gives that refinement, expansion, and wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>interest to feelings of this sort, when strongly excited, which every
one must have experienced who is a true lover of Nature. The
sight of the setting sun does not affect me so much from the beauty
of the object itself, from the glory kindled through the glowing skies,
the rich broken columns of light, or the dying streaks of day, as that
it indistinctly recalls to me numberless thoughts and feelings with
which, through many a year and season, I have watched his bright
descent in the warm summer evenings, or beheld him struggling to cast
a ‘farewel sweet’ through the thick clouds of winter. I love to see
the trees first covered with leaves in the spring, the primroses peeping
out from some sheltered bank, and the innocent lambs running races
on the soft green turf; because, at that birth-time of Nature, I have
always felt sweet hopes and happy wishes—which have not been
fulfilled! The dry reeds rustling on the side of a stream,—the woods
swept by the loud blast,—the dark massy foliage of autumn,—the grey
trunks and naked branches of the trees in winter,—the sequestered
copse and wide extended heath,—the warm sunny showers, and
December snows,—have all charms for me; there is no object, however
trifling or rude, that has not, in some mood or other, found
the way to my heart; and I might say, in the words of the poet,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To me the meanest flower that blows can give</div>
      <div class='line'>Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus Nature is a kind of universal home, and every object it presents
to us an old acquaintance with unaltered looks.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>——‘Nature did ne’er betray</div>
      <div class='line'>The heart that lov’d her, but through all the years</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this our life, it is her privilege</div>
      <div class='line'>To lead from joy to joy.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>For there is that consent and mutual harmony among all her works,
one undivided spirit pervading them throughout, that, if we have
once knit ourselves in hearty fellowship to any of them, they will
never afterwards appear as strangers to us, but, which ever way we turn,
we shall find a secret power to have gone out before us, moulding
them into such shapes as fancy loves, informing them with life and
sympathy, bidding them put on their festive looks and gayest attire at
our approach, and to pour all their sweets and choicest treasures at
our feet. For him, then, who has well acquainted himself with
Nature’s works, she wears always one face, and speaks the same well-known
language, striking on the heart, amidst unquiet thoughts and
the tumult of the world, like the music of one’s native tongue heard
in some far-off country.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>We do not connect the same feelings with the works of art as with
those of nature, because we refer them to man, and associate with
them the separate interests and passions which we know belong to
those who are the authors or possessors of them. Nevertheless, there
are some such objects, as a cottage, or a village church, which excite
in us the same sensations as the sight of nature, and which are,
indeed, almost always included in descriptions of natural scenery.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Which is in part, no doubt, because they are surrounded with natural
objects, and, in a populous country, inseparable from them; and also
because the human interest they excite relates to manners and feelings
which are simple, common, such as all can enter into, and which,
therefore, always produce a pleasing effect upon the mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been much disputed whether Shakspeare was actuated by the
love of fame, though the question has been thought by others not to
admit of any doubt, on the ground that it was impossible for any man
of great genius to be without this feeling. It was supposed, that that
immortality, which was the natural inheritance of men of powerful
genius, must be ever present to their minds, as the reward, the object,
and the animating spring, of all their efforts. This conclusion
does not appear to be well founded, and that for the following
reasons:</p>

<p class='c000'>First, The love of fame is the offspring of taste, rather than of
genius. The love of fame implies a knowledge of its existence.
The men of the greatest genius, whether poets or philosophers, who
lived in the first ages of society, only just emerging from the gloom of
ignorance and barbarism, could not be supposed to have much idea of
those long trails of lasting glory which they were to leave behind
them, and of which there were as yet no examples. But, after such
men, inspired by the love of truth and nature, have struck out those
lights which become the gaze and admiration of after times,—when
those who succeed in distant generations read with wondering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>rapture the works which the bards and sages of antiquity have bequeathed
to them,—when they contemplate the imperishable power of
intellect which survives the stroke of death and the revolutions of
empire,—it is then that the passion for fame becomes an habitual feeling
in the mind, and that men naturally wish to excite the same
sentiments of admiration in others which they themselves have felt,
and to transmit their names with the same honours to posterity. It is
from the fond enthusiastic veneration with which we recal the names
of the celebrated men of past times, and the idolatrous worship we
pay to their memories, that we learn what a delicious thing fame is,
and would willingly make any efforts or sacrifices to be thought of
in the same way. It is in the true spirit of this feeling that a modern
writer exclaims—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Blessings be with them, and eternal praise,</div>
      <div class='line'>The poets—who on earth have made us heirs</div>
      <div class='line'>Of truth and pure delight in deathless lays!</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! might my name be number’d among theirs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then gladly would I end my mortal days!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The love of fame is a species of emulation; or, in other words, the
love of admiration is in proportion to the admiration with which the
works of the highest genius have inspired us, to the delight we have
received from their habitual contemplation, and to our participation in
the general enthusiasm with which they have been regarded by mankind.
Thus there is little of this feeling discoverable in the Greek
writers, whose ideas of posthumous fame seem to have been confined
to the glory of heroic actions; whereas the Roman poets and
orators, stimulated by the reputation which their predecessors had
acquired, and having those exquisite models constantly before their
eyes, are full of it. So Milton, whose capacious mind was imbued
with the rich stores of sacred and of classic lore, to whom learning
opened her inmost page, and whose eye seemed to be ever bent back
to the great models of antiquity, was, it is evident, deeply impressed
with a feeling of lofty emulation, and a strong desire to produce some
work of lasting and equal reputation:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>——‘Nor sometimes forget</div>
      <div class='line'>Those other two, equall’d with me in fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>So were I equall’d with them in renown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Blind Thamyris and blind Mæonides,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Tiresias and Phineus, prophets old.’<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Spenser, who was a man of learning, had a high opinion of the regard
due to ‘famous poets’ wit’; and Lord Bacon, whose vanity is as well
known as his excessive adulation of that of others, asks, in a tone
of proud exultation, ‘Have not the poems of Homer lasted five-and-twenty
hundred years, and not a syllable of them is lost?’
Chaucer seems to have derived his notions of fame more immediately
from the reputation acquired by the Italian poets, his contemporaries,
which had at that time spread itself over Europe; while the latter,
who were the first to unlock the springs of ancient learning, and who
slaked their thirst of knowledge at that pure fountain-head, would
naturally imbibe the same feeling from its highest source. Thus,
Dante has conveyed the finest image that can perhaps be conceived of
the power of this principle over the human mind, when he describes
the heroes and celebrated men of antiquity as ‘serene and smiling,’
though in the shades of death,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>——‘Because on earth their names</div>
      <div class='line'>In Fame’s eternal volume shine for aye.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But it is not so in Shakspeare. There is scarcely the slightest trace
of any such feeling in his writings, nor any appearance of anxiety for
their fate, or of a desire to perfect them or make them worthy of that
immortality to which they were destined. And this indifference may
be accounted for from the very circumstance, that he was almost
entirely a man of genius, or that in him this faculty bore sway over
every other: he was either not intimately conversant with the productions
of the great writers who had gone before him, or at least was
not much indebted to them: he revelled in the world of observation
and of fancy; and perhaps his mind was of too prolific and active
a kind to dwell with intense and continued interest on the images of
beauty or of grandeur presented to it by the genius of others. He
seemed scarcely to have an individual existence of his own, but to
borrow that of others at will, and to pass successively through ‘every
variety of untried being,’—to be now <cite>Hamlet</cite>, now <cite>Othello</cite>, now
<cite>Lear</cite>, now <cite>Falstaff</cite>, now <cite>Ariel</cite>. In the mingled interests and feelings
belonging to this wide range of imaginary reality, in the tumult and
rapid transitions of this waking dream, the author could not easily
find time to think of himself, nor wish to embody that personal
identity in idle reputation after death, of which he was so little
tenacious while living. To feel a strong desire that others should
think highly of us, it is, in general, necessary that we should think
highly of ourselves. There is something of egotism, and even
pedantry, in this sentiment; and there is no author who was so little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>tinctured with these as Shakspeare. The passion for fame, like other
passions, requires an exclusive and exaggerated admiration of its
object, and attaches more consequence to literary attainments and
pursuits than they really possess. Shakspeare had looked too much
abroad into the world, and his views of things were of too universal
and comprehensive a cast, not to have taught him to estimate the
importance of posthumous fame according to its true value and relative
proportions. Though he might have some conception of his future
fame, he could not but feel the contrast between that and his actual
situation; and, indeed, he complains bitterly of the latter in one of
his sonnets.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> He would perhaps think, that, to be the idol of
posterity, when we are no more, was hardly a full compensation for
being the object of the glance and scorn of fools while we are living;
and that, in truth, this universal fame so much vaunted, was a vague
phantom of blind enthusiasm; for what is the amount even of Shakspeare’s
fame? That, in that very country which boasts his genius
and his birth, perhaps not one person in ten has ever heard of his
name, or read a syllable of his writings!</p>

<p class='c000'>We will add another observation in connection with this subject,
which is, that men of the greatest genius produce their works with
too much facility (and, as it were, spontaneously) to require the love
of fame as a stimulus to their exertions, or to make them seem
deserving of the admiration of mankind as their reward. It is, indeed,
one characteristic mark of the highest class of excellence to appear
to come naturally from the mind of the author, without consciousness
or effort. The work seems like inspiration—to be the gift of some
God or of the Muse. But it is the sense of difficulty which enhances
the admiration of power, both in ourselves and in others. Hence it
is that there is nothing so remote from vanity as true genius. It is
almost as natural for those who are endowed with the highest powers
of the human mind to produce the miracles of art, as for other men to
breathe or move. Correggio, who is said to have produced some
of his divinest works almost without having seen a picture, probably
did not know that he had done anything extraordinary.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The superiority of the pictures of Hogarth, which we have seen in
the late collection at the British Institution, to the common prints, is
confined chiefly to the <cite>Marriage a-la-Mode</cite>. We shall attempt to
illustrate a few of their most striking excellencies, more particularly
with reference to the expression of character. Their merits are
indeed so prominent, and have been so often discussed, that it may be
thought difficult to point out any new beauties; but they contain so
much truth of nature, they present the objects to the eye under so
many aspects and bearings, admit of so many constructions, and are
so pregnant with meaning, that the subject is in a manner inexhaustible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boccacio, the most refined and sentimental of all the novel-writers,
has been stigmatised as a mere inventor of licentious tales, because
readers in general have only seized on those things in his works which
were suited to their own taste, and have reflected their own grossness
back upon the writer. So it has happened that the majority of critics
having been most struck with the strong and decided expression in
Hogarth, the extreme delicacy and subtle gradations of character in
his pictures have almost entirely escaped them. In the first picture
of the <cite>Marriage a-la-Mode</cite>, the three figures of the young Nobleman,
his intended Bride, and her inamorato, the Lawyer, shew how much
Hogarth excelled in the power of giving soft and effeminate expression.
They have, however, been less noticed than the other figures, which
tell a plainer story and convey a more palpable moral. Nothing can
be more finely managed than the differences of character in these
delicate personages. The Beau sits smiling at the looking-glass, with
a reflected simper of self-admiration, and a languishing inclination of
the head, while the rest of his body is perked up on his high heels
with a certain air of tiptoe elevation. He is the Narcissus of the
reign of George <span class='fss'>II.</span>, whose powdered peruke, ruffles, gold lace, and
patches, divide his self-love unequally with his own person,—the true
Sir Plume of his day;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Of amber-lidded snuff-box justly vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the nice conduct of a clouded cane.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is the same felicity in the figure and attitude of the Bride,
courted by the Lawyer. There is the utmost flexibility, and yielding
softness in her whole person, a listless languor and tremulous suspense
in the expression of her face. It is the precise look and air which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Pope has given to his favourite Belinda, just at the moment of the
<cite>Rape of the Lock</cite>. The heightened glow, the forward intelligence,
and loosened soul of love in the same face, in the assignation scene
before the masquerade, form a fine and instructive contrast to the
delicacy, timidity, and coy reluctance expressed in the first. The
Lawyer in both pictures is much the same—perhaps too much so—though
even this unmoved, unaltered appearance may be designed as
characteristic. In both cases he has ‘a person, and a smooth dispose,
framed to make woman false.’ He is full of that easy good-humour
and easy good opinion of himself, with which the sex are delighted.
There is not a sharp angle in his face to obstruct his success, or give
a hint of doubt or difficulty. His whole aspect is round and rosy,
lively and unmeaning, happy without the least expense of thought,
careless and inviting; and conveys a perfect idea of the uninterrupted
glide and pleasing murmur of the soft periods that flow from his
tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expression of the Bride in the Morning Scene is the most
highly seasoned, and at the same time the most vulgar in the series.
The figure, face, and attitude of the Husband are inimitable. Hogarth
has with great skill contrasted the pale countenance of the husband
with the yellow whitish colour of the marble chimney-piece behind
him, in such a manner as to preserve the fleshy tone of the former.
The airy splendour of the view of the inner room in this picture is
probably not exceeded by any of the productions of the Flemish School.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Young Girl in the third picture, who is represented as the
victim of fashionable profligacy, is unquestionably one of the artist’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></span></i>. The exquisite delicacy of the painting is only surpassed
by the felicity and subtlety of the conception. Nothing can
be more striking than the contrast between the extreme softness
of her person, and the hardened indifference of her character. The
vacant stillness, the docility to vice, the premature suppression of
youthful sensibility, the doll-like mechanism of the whole figure,
which seems to have no other feeling but a sickly sense of pain,—shew
the deepest insight into human nature, and into the effects of
those refinements in depravity by which it has been good-naturedly
asserted, that ‘vice loses half its evil in losing all its grossness.’ The
story of this picture is in some parts very obscure and enigmatical.
It is certain that the Nobleman is not looking straightforward to the
Quack, whom he seems to have been threatening with his cane, but
that his eyes are turned up with an ironical leer of triumph to the
Procuress. The commanding attitude and size of this woman, the
swelling circumference of her dress, spread out like a turkey-cock’s
feathers,—the fierce, ungovernable, inveterate malignity of her countenance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>which hardly needs the comment of the clasp-knife to explain
her purpose, are all admirable in themselves, and still more so, as they
are opposed to the mute insensibility, the elegant negligence of the
dress, and the childish figure of the girl, who is supposed to be her
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</span></i>. As for the Quack, there can be no doubt entertained about
him. His face seems as if it were composed of salve, and his
features exhibit all the chaos and confusion of the most gross,
ignorant, and impudent empiricism.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gradations of ridiculous affectation in the Music Scene are
finely imagined and preserved. The preposterous, overstrained
admiration of the Lady of Quality, the sentimental, insipid, patient
delight of the Man with his hair in papers and sipping his tea,—the
pert, smirking, conceited, half-distorted approbation of the figure next
to him, the transition to the total insensibility of the round face in
profile, and then to the wonder of the Negro-boy at the rapture of
his Mistress, form a perfect whole. The sanguine complexion and
flame-coloured hair of the female Virtuoso throw an additional light
on the character. This is lost in the print. The continuing the red
colour of the hair into the back of the chair has been pointed out as
one of those instances of alliteration in colouring, of which these
pictures are everywhere full. The gross bloated appearance of the
Italian Singer is well relieved by the hard features of the instrumental
performer behind him, which might be carved of wood. The Negro-boy,
holding the chocolate, both in expression, colour, and execution,
is a master-piece. The gay, lively derision of the other Negro boy,
playing with the Actæon, is an ingenious contrast to the profound
amazement of the first. Some account has already been given of the
two lovers in this picture. It is curious to observe the infinite activity
of mind which the artist displays on every occasion. An instance
occurs in the present picture. He has so contrived the papers in the
hair of the Bride, as to make them look almost like a wreath of half-blown
flowers, while those which he has placed on the head of the
musical Amateur very much resemble a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheveux-de-frise</span></i> of horns, which
adorn and fortify the lack-lustre expression and mild resignation of the
face beneath.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Night Scene is inferior to the rest of the series. The attitude
of the Husband, who is just killed, is one in which it would be impossible
for him to stand or even to fall. It resembles the loose
pasteboard figures they make for children. The characters in the
last picture, in which the Wife dies, are all masterly. We would
particularly refer to the captious, petulant self-sufficiency of the
Apothecary, whose face and figure are constructed on exact physiognomical
principles, and to the fine example of passive obedience and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>non-resistance in the Servant, whom he is taking to task, and whose
coat of green and yellow livery is as long and melancholy as his face.
The disconsolate look, the haggard eyes, the open mouth, the comb
sticking in the hair, the broken, gapped teeth, which, as it were, hitch
in an answer—every thing about him denotes the utmost perplexity
and dismay. The harmony and gradations of colour in this picture
are uniformly preserved with the greatest nicety, and are well worthy
the attention of the artist.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 9.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; THE SUBJECT CONTINUED&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>June 19, 1814.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It has been observed, that Hogarth’s pictures are exceedingly unlike
any other representations of the same kind of subjects—that they
form a class, and have a character, peculiar to themselves. It may
be worth while to consider in what this general distinction consists.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, they are, in the strictest sense, <em>Historical</em> pictures;
and if what Fielding says be true, that his novel of <cite>Tom Jones</cite> ought
to be regarded as an epic prose-poem, because it contained a regular
developement of fable, manners, character, and passion, the compositions
of Hogarth will, in like manner, be found to have a higher
claim to the title of Epic Pictures than many which have of late
arrogated that denomination to themselves. When we say that
Hogarth treated his subjects historically, we mean that his works
represent the manners and humours of mankind in action, and their
characters by varied expression. Every thing in his pictures has life
and motion in it. Not only does the business of the scene never
stand still, but every feature and muscle is put into full play; the
exact feeling of the moment is brought out, and carried to its utmost
height, and then instantly seized and stamped on the canvass for ever.
The expression is always taken <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</span></i>, in a state of progress or
change, and, as it were, at the salient point. Besides the excellence
of each individual face, the reflection of the expression from face to
face, the contrast and struggle of particular motives and feelings in
the different actors in the scene, as of anger, contempt, laughter,
compassion, are conveyed in the happiest and most lively manner.
His figures are not like the back-ground on which they are painted:
even the pictures on the wall have a peculiar look of their own.
Again, with the rapidity, variety, and scope of history, Hogarth’s
heads have all the reality and correctness of portraits. He gives the
extremes of character and expression, but he gives them with perfect
truth and accuracy. This is, in fact, what distinguishes his compositions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>from all others of the same kind, that they are equally
remote from caricature, and from mere still life. It of course happens
in subjects from common life, that the painter can procure real models,
and he can get them to sit as long as he pleases. Hence, in general,
those attitudes and expressions have been chosen which could be
assumed the longest; and in imitating which, the artist, by taking
pains and time, might produce almost as complete fac-similes as he
could of a flower or a flower-pot, of a damask curtain, or a china
vase. The copy was as perfect and as uninteresting in the one case
as in the other. On the contrary, subjects of drollery and ridicule
affording frequent examples of strange deformity and peculiarity of
features, these have been eagerly seized by another class of artists,
who, without subjecting themselves to the laborious drudgery of the
Dutch School and their imitators, have produced our popular caricatures,
by rudely copying or exaggerating the casual irregularities
of the human countenance. Hogarth has equally avoided the faults
of both these styles, the insipid tameness of the one, and the gross
vulgarity of the other, so as to give to the productions of his pencil
equal solidity and effect. For his faces go to the very verge of
caricature, and yet never (we believe in any single instance) go
beyond it: they take the very widest latitude, and yet we always
see the links which bind them to nature: they bear all the marks
and carry all the conviction of reality with them, as if we had seen
the actual faces for the first time, from the precision, consistency, and
good sense, with which the whole and every part is made out. They
exhibit the most uncommon features with the most uncommon expressions,
but which are yet as familiar and intelligible as possible,
because with all the boldness they have all the truth of nature.
Hogarth has left behind him as many of these memorable faces,
in their memorable moments, as perhaps most of us remember in
the course of our lives, and has thus doubled the quantity of our
observation.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have, in a former paper, attempted to point out the fund of
observation, physical and moral, contained in one set of these pictures,
the <cite>Marriage a-la-Mode</cite>. The rest would furnish as many topics
to descant upon, were the patience of the reader as inexhaustible as
the painter’s invention. But as this is not the case, we shall content
ourselves with barely referring to some of those figures in the other
pictures, which appear the most striking, and which we see not only
while we are looking at them, but which we have before us at all
other times. For instance, who having seen can easily forget that
exquisite frost-piece of religion and morality, the antiquated Prude
in the Morning Scene; or that striking commentary on the <em>good old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>times</em>, the little wretched appendage of a Foot-boy, who crawls half
famished and half frozen behind her? The French Man and Woman
in the Noon are the perfection of flighty affectation and studied
grimace; the amiable <em>fraternisation</em> of the two old Women saluting
each other is not enough to be admired; and in the little Master, in
the same national group, we see the early promise and personification
of that eternal principle of wondrous self-complacency, proof against
all circumstances, and which makes the French the only people
who are vain even of being cuckolded and being conquered! Or
shall we prefer to this the outrageous distress and unmitigated terrors
of the Boy, who has dropped his dish of meat, and who seems red
all over with shame and vexation, and bursting with the noise he
makes? Or what can be better than the good housewifery of the
Girl underneath, who is devouring the lucky fragments, or than the
plump, ripe, florid, luscious look of the Servant-wench, embraced by
a greasy rascal of an Othello, with her pye-dish tottering like her
virtue, and with the most precious part of its contents running over?
Just—no, not quite—as good is the joke of the Woman over-head,
who, having quarrelled with her husband, is throwing their Sunday’s
dinner out of the window, to complete this chapter of accidents of
baked-dishes. The Husband in the Evening Scene is certainly as meek
as any recorded in history; but we cannot say that we admire this
picture, or the Night Scene after it. But then, in the Taste in High
Life, there is that inimitable pair, differing only in sex, congratulating
and delighting one another by ‘all the mutually reflected charities’
of folly and affectation, with the young Lady coloured like a rose,
dandling her little, black, pug-faced, white-teethed, chuckling favourite,
and with the portrait of Mons. Des Noyers in the back-ground,
dancing in a grand ballet, surrounded by butterflies. And again, in
the Election Dinner, is the immortal Cobler, surrounded by his
Peers, who, ‘frequent and full,’—</p>

<p class='c000'>the Jew in the second picture, a very Jew in grain—innumerable fine
sketches of heads in the Polling for Votes, of which the Nobleman
overlooking the caricaturist is the best; and then the irresistible
tumultuous display of broad humour in the Chairing the Member,
which is, perhaps, of all Hogarth’s pictures, the most full of laughable
incidents and situations—the yellow, rusty-faced thresher, with
his swinging flail, breaking the head of one of the Chairmen, and his
redoubted antagonist, the Sailor, with his oak-stick, and stumping
wooden leg, a supplemental cudgel—the persevering ecstasy of the
hobbling Blind Fiddler, who, in the fray, appears to have been trod
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>upon by the artificial excrescence of the honest Tar—Monsieur, the
Monkey, with piteous aspect, speculating the impending disaster of
the triumphant candidate, and his brother Bruin, appropriating the
paunch—the precipitous flight of the Pigs, souse over head into the
water, the fine Lady fainting, with vermilion lips, and the two Chimney-sweepers,
satirical young rogues! We had almost forgot the
Politician who is burning a hole through his hat with a candle in
reading the newspaper; and the Chickens, in the <cite>March to Finchley</cite>,
wandering in search of their lost dam, who is found in the pocket
of the Serjeant. Of the pictures in the <cite>Rake’s Progress</cite> in this
collection, we shall not here say any thing, because we think them,
on the whole, inferior to the prints, and because they have already
been criticised by a writer, to whom we could add nothing, in a
paper which ought to be read by every lover of Hogarth and of
English genius.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of all Milton’s smaller poems, <em>Lycidas</em> is the greatest favourite
with us. We cannot agree to the charge which Dr. Johnson has
brought against it, of pedantry and want of feeling. It is the fine
emanation of classical sentiment in a youthful scholar—‘most musical,
most melancholy.’ A certain tender gloom overspreads it, a wayward
abstraction, a forgetfulness of his subject in the serious reflections
that arise out of it. The gusts of passion come and go like the
sounds of music borne on the wind. The loss of the friend whose
death he laments seems to have recalled, with double force, the reality
of those speculations which they had indulged together; we are
transported to classic ground, and a mysterious strain steals responsive
on the ear while we listen to the poet,</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>sweetness of the natural descriptions as for the characteristic elegance
of the allusions:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Together both, ere the high lawns appear’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Under the opening eye-lids of the morn,</div>
      <div class='line'>We drove a-field; and both together heard</div>
      <div class='line'>What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft till the star that rose at evening bright</div>
      <div class='line'>Towards Heaven’s descent had sloped his westering wheel.</div>
      <div class='line'>Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,</div>
      <div class='line'>Temper’d to the oaten flute:</div>
      <div class='line'>Rough satyrs danced, and fauns with cloven heel</div>
      <div class='line'>From the glad sound would not be absent long,</div>
      <div class='line'>And old Dametas loved to hear our song.</div>
      <div class='line'>But oh the heavy change, now thou art gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now thou art gone, and never must return!</div>
      <div class='line'>Thee, shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves</div>
      <div class='line'>With wild thyme and the gadding vine o’ergrown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all their echoes mourn.</div>
      <div class='line'>The willows and the hazel copses green</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall now no more be seen</div>
      <div class='line'>Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.</div>
      <div class='line'>As killing as the canker to the rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear,</div>
      <div class='line'>When first the white-thorn blows;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd’s ear!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>After the fine apostrophe on Fame which Phœbus is invoked to
utter, the poet proceeds:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh fountain Arethuse, and thou honour’d flood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown’d with vocal reeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>That strain I heard was of a higher mood;</div>
      <div class='line'>But now my oat proceeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And listens to the herald of the sea</div>
      <div class='line'>That came in Neptune’s plea.</div>
      <div class='line'>He ask’d the waves, and ask’d the felon winds,</div>
      <div class='line'>What hard mishap hath doom’d this gentle swain?</div>
      <div class='line'>And question’d every gust of rugged winds</div>
      <div class='line'>That blows from off each beaked promontory.</div>
      <div class='line'>They knew not of his story:</div>
      <div class='line'>And sage Hippotades their answer brings,</div>
      <div class='line'>That not a blast was from his dungeon stray’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>The air was calm, and on the level brine</div>
      <div class='line'>Sleek Panope with all her sisters play’d.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If this is art, it is perfect art; nor do we wish for anything better.
The measure of the verse, the very sound of the names, would almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>produce the effect here described. To ask the poet not to make
use of such allusions as these, is to ask the painter not to dip in
the colours of the rainbow, if he could. In fact, it is the common
cant of criticism to consider every allusion to the classics, and particularly
in a mind like Milton’s, as pedantry and affectation. Habit is
a second nature; and, in this sense, the pedantry (if it is to be called
so) of the scholastic enthusiast, who is constantly referring to images
of which his mind is full, is as graceful as it is natural. It is not
affectation in him to recur to ideas and modes of expression, with
which he has the strongest associations, and in which he takes the
greatest delight. Milton was as conversant with the world of genius
before him as with the world of nature about him; the fables of the
ancient mythology were as familiar to him as his dreams. To be a
pedant, is to see neither the beauties of nature nor of art. Milton
saw both; and he made use of the one only to adorn and give new
interest to the other. He was a passionate admirer of nature; and,
in a single couplet of his, describing the moon,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like one that had been led astray</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the heaven’s wide pathless way,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>there is more intense observation, and intense feeling of nature (as if
he had gazed himself blind in looking at her), than in twenty volumes
of descriptive poetry. But he added to his own observation of
nature the splendid fictions of ancient genius, enshrined her in the
mysteries of ancient religion, and celebrated her with the pomp of
ancient names.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow,</div>
      <div class='line'>His mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge,</div>
      <div class='line'>Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge</div>
      <div class='line'>Like to that sanguine flower inscrib’d with woe.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! who hath reft (quoth he) my dearest pledge?</div>
      <div class='line'>Last came, and last did go,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pilot of the Galilean lake.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is a wonderful correspondence in the rhythm of these lines to
the idea which they convey. This passage, which alludes to the
clerical character of <em>Lycidas</em>, has been found fault with, as combining
the truths of the Christian religion with the fictions of the heathen
mythology. We conceive there is very little foundation for this
objection, either in reason or good taste. We will not go so far as
to defend Camoens, who, in his <cite>Lusiad</cite>, makes Jupiter send Mercury
with a dream to propagate the Catholic religion; nor do we know
that it is generally proper to introduce the two things in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>poem, though we see no objection to it here; but of this we are
quite sure, that there is no inconsistency or natural repugnance
between this poetical and religious faith in the same mind. To the
understanding, the belief of the one is incompatible with that of the
other; but in the imagination, they not only may, but do constantly
co-exist. We will venture to go farther, and maintain, that every
classical scholar, however orthodox a Christian he may be, is an
honest Heathen at heart. This requires explanation. Whoever,
then, attaches a reality to any idea beyond the mere name, has, to a
certain extent, (though not an abstract), an habitual and practical belief
in it. Now, to any one familiar with the names of the personages of the
Heathen mythology, they convey a positive identity beyond the mere
name. We refer them to something out of ourselves. It is only by
an effort of abstraction that we divest ourselves of the idea of their
reality; all our involuntary prejudices are on their side. This is
enough for the poet. They impose on the imagination by all the
attractions of beauty and grandeur. They come down to us in
sculpture and in song. We have the same associations with them, as
if they had really been; for the belief of the fiction in ancient times
has produced all the same effects as the reality could have done. It
was a reality to the minds of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and
through them it is reflected to us. And, as we shape towers, and men,
and armed steeds, out of the broken clouds that glitter in the distant
horizon, so, throned above the ruins of the ancient world, Jupiter
still nods sublime on the top of blue Olympus, Hercules leans upon
his club, Apollo has not laid aside his bow, nor Neptune his trident; the
sea-gods ride upon the sounding waves, the long procession of heroes
and demi-gods passes in endless review before us, and still we hear</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>——‘The Muses in a ring</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>If all these mighty fictions had really existed, they could have done
no more for us! We shall only give one other passage from <em>Lycidas</em>;
but we flatter ourselves that it will be a treat to our readers, if they
are not already familiar with it. It is the passage which contains that
exquisite description of the flowers:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Return, Alpheus; the dread voice is past</div>

      <div class='line'>Throw hither all your quaint enamell’d eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>That on the green turf suck the honied showers,</div>
      <div class='line'>And purple all the ground with vernal flowers;</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,</div>
      <div class='line'>The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,</div>

      <div class='line'>For so to interpose a little ease</div>

      <div class='line'>Ay me! Whilst thee the shores and sounding seas</div>
      <div class='line'>Waft far away, where’er thy bones are hurl’d,</div>

      <div class='line'>Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide</div>

      <div class='line'>Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,</div>

      <div class='line'>Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, O ye Dolphins, waft the hapless youth.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Johnson is very much offended at the introduction of these
Dolphins; and indeed, if he had had to guide them through the waves,
he would have made much the same figure as his old friend Dr.
Burney does, swimming in the <em>Thames</em> with his wig on, with the
water-nymphs, in the picture by Barry at the Adelphi.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a description of flowers in the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite>, which we
shall give as a parallel to Milton’s. We shall leave it to the reader
to decide which is the finest; for we dare not give the preference.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Johnson’s general remark, that Milton’s genius had not room
to show itself in his smaller pieces, is not well-founded. Not to
mention <em>Lycidas</em>, the <em>Allegro</em>, and <em>Penseroso</em>, it proceeds on a false
estimate of the merits of his great work, which is not more distinguished
by strength and sublimity than by tenderness and beauty. The last
were as essential qualities of Milton’s mind as the first. The battle
of the angels, which has been commonly considered as the best part
of the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, is the worst.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 11.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON MILTON’S VERSIFICATION&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Aug. 20, 1815.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Milton’s works are a perpetual invocation to the Muses; a hymn to
Fame. His religious zeal infused its character into his imagination;
and he devotes himself with the same sense of duty to the cultivation
of his genius, as he did to the exercise of virtue, or the good of his
country. He does not write from casual impulse, but after a severe
examination of his own strength, and with a determination to leave
nothing undone which it is in his power to do. He always labours,
and he almost always succeeds. He strives to say the finest things
in the world, and he does say them. He adorns and dignifies his
subject to the utmost. He surrounds it with all the possible associations
of beauty or grandeur, whether moral, or physical, or intellectual.
He refines on his descriptions of beauty, till the sense almost aches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>at them, and raises his images of terror to a gigantic elevation, that
‘makes Ossa like a wart.’ He has a high standard, with which
he is constantly comparing himself, and nothing short of which can
satisfy him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——‘Sad task, yet argument</div>
      <div class='line'>Not less but more heroic than the wrath</div>
      <div class='line'>Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued,</div>
      <div class='line'>If answerable stile I can obtain.</div>
      <div class='line'>——Unless an age too late, or cold</div>
      <div class='line'>Climate, or years, damp my intended wing.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Milton has borrowed more than any other writer; yet he is
perfectly distinct from every other writer. The power of his mind is
stamped on every line. He is a writer of centos, and yet in originality
only inferior to Homer. The quantity of art shews the strength of
his genius; so much art would have overloaded any other writer.
Milton’s learning has all the effect of intuition. He describes objects
of which he had only read in books, with the vividness of actual
observation. His imagination has the force of nature. He makes
words tell as pictures:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat</div>
      <div class='line'>Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Abbana and Pharphar, <em>lucid</em> streams.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘As when a vulture on Imaus bred,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dislodging from a region scarce of prey</div>
      <div class='line'>To gorge the flesh of lambs or yearling kids</div>
      <div class='line'>On hills where flocks are fed, <em>flies towards the springs</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>But in his way lights on the barren plains</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Of Sericana, where Chineses drive</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>With sails and wind their cany waggons light</em>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Such passages may be considered as demonstrations of history.
Instances might be multiplied without end. There is also a decided
tone in his descriptions, an eloquent dogmatism, as if the poet
spoke from thorough conviction, which Milton probably derived from
his spirit of partisanship, or else his spirit of partisanship from the
natural firmness and vehemence of his mind. In this Milton resembles
Dante, (the only one of the moderns with whom he has anything in
common), and it is remarkable that Dante, as well as Milton, was a
political partisan. That approximation to the severity of impassioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>prose which has been made an objection to Milton’s poetry, is one of
its chief excellencies. It has been suggested, that the vividness with
which he describes visible objects, might be owing to their having
acquired a greater strength in his mind after the privation of sight;
but we find the same palpableness and solidity in the descriptions
which occur in his early poems. There is, indeed, the same depth
of impression in his descriptions of the objects of the other senses.
Milton had as much of what is meant by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i> as any poet. He
forms the most intense conceptions of things, and then embodies them
by a single stroke of his pen. Force of style is perhaps his first
excellence. Hence he stimulates us most in the reading, and less
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been said that Milton’s ideas were musical rather than
picturesque, but this observation is not true, in the sense in which it
was meant. The ear, indeed, predominates over the eye, because it
is more immediately affected, and because the language of music
blends more immediately with, and forms a more natural accompaniment
to, the variable and indefinite associations of ideas conveyed by
words. But where the associations of the imagination are not the
principal thing, the individual object is given by Milton with equal
force and beauty. The strongest and best proof of this, as a characteristic
power of his mind, is, that the persons of Adam and Eve, of
Satan, etc., are always accompanied, in our imagination, with the
grandeur of the naked figure; they convey to us the ideas of sculpture.
As an instance, take the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>——‘He soon</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>The same whom John saw also in the sun:</div>
      <div class='line'>His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar</div>
      <div class='line'>Circled his head, nor less his locks behind</div>
      <div class='line'>Illustrious on his shoulders fledged with wings</div>
      <div class='line'>Lay waving round; on some great charge employ’d</div>
      <div class='line'>He seem’d, or fix’d in cogitation deep.</div>
      <div class='line'>Glad was the spirit impure, as now in hope</div>
      <div class='line'>To find who might direct his wand’ring flight</div>
      <div class='line'>To Paradise, the happy seat of man,</div>
      <div class='line'>His journey’s end, and our beginning woe.</div>
      <div class='line'>But first he casts to change his proper shape,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which else might work him danger or delay:</div>
      <div class='line'>And now a stripling cherub he appears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not of the prime, yet such as in his face</div>
      <div class='line'>Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb</div>
      <div class='line'>Suitable grace diffus’d, so well he feign’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>Under a coronet his flowing hair</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>In curls on either cheek play’d; wings he wore</div>
      <div class='line'>Of many a colour’d plume sprinkled with gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>His habit fit for speed succinct, and held</div>
      <div class='line'>Before his decent steps a silver wand.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The figures introduced here have all the elegance and precision of
a Greek statue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Milton’s blank verse is the only blank verse in the language (except
Shakspeare’s) which is readable. Dr. Johnson, who had modelled
his ideas of versification on the regular sing-song of Pope, condemns
the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> as harsh and unequal. We shall not pretend to
say that this is not sometimes the case; for where a degree of
excellence beyond the mechanical rules of art is attempted the poet
must sometimes fail. But we imagine that there are more perfect
examples in Milton of musical expression, or of an adaptation of the
sound and movement of the verse to the meaning of the passage, than
in all our other writers, whether of rhyme or blank verse, put together,
(with the exception already mentioned). Spenser is the most
harmonious of our poets, and Dryden is the most sounding and varied
of our rhymists. But in neither is there anything like the same ear
for music, the same power of approximating the varieties of poetical
to those of musical rhythm, as there is in our great epic poet. The
sound of his lines is moulded into the expression of the sentiment,
almost of the very image. They rise or fall, pause or hurry rapidly

      <div class='line'>Dropt from the zenith like a falling star</div>

<p class='c000'>The verse, in this exquisitely modulated passage, floats up and

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 12.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON MANNER&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Aug. 27, 1815.</span>      [<span class='sc'>Sep. 3, 1815.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was the opinion of Lord Chesterfield, that <em>manner</em> is of more
importance than <em>matter</em>. This opinion seems at least to be warranted
by the practice of the world; nor do we think it so entirely without
foundation as some persons of more solid than showy pretensions
would make us believe. In the remarks which we are going to
make, we can scarcely hope to have any party very warmly on our
side; for the most superficial coxcomb would be thought to owe his
success to sterling merit.</p>

<p class='c000'>What any person says or does is one thing; the mode in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>he says or does it is another. The last of these is what we understand
by <em>manner</em>. In other words, manner is the involuntary or
incidental expression given to our thoughts and sentiments by looks,
tones, and gestures. Now, we are inclined in many cases to prefer
this latter mode of judging of what passes in the mind to more
positive and formal proof, were it for no other reason than that it is
involuntary. ‘Look,’ says Lord Chesterfield, ‘in the face of the
person to whom you are speaking, if you wish to know his real
sentiments; for he can command his words more easily than his
countenance.’ We may perform certain actions from design, or repeat
certain professions by rote: the manner of doing either will in general
be the best test of our sincerity. The mode of conferring a favour
is often thought of more value than the favour itself. The actual
obligation may spring from a variety of questionable motives, vanity,
affectation, or interest: the cordiality with which the person from
whom you have received it asks you how you do, or shakes you by
the hand, does not admit of misinterpretation. The manner of doing
any thing, is that which marks the degree and force of our internal
impressions; it emanates most directly from our immediate or habitual
feelings; it is that which stamps its life and character on any action;
the rest may be performed by an automaton. What is it that makes
the difference between the best and the worst actor, but the manner
of going through the same part? The one has a perfect idea of the
degree and force with which certain feelings operate in nature, and
the other has no idea at all of the workings of passion. There would
be no difference between the worst actor in the world and the best,
placed in real circumstances, and under the influence of real passion.
A writer may express the thoughts he has borrowed from another,
but not with the same force, unless he enters into the true spirit of
them. Otherwise he will resemble a person reading what he does
not understand, whom you immediately detect by his wrong emphasis.
His illustrations will be literally exact, but misplaced and awkward;
he will not gradually warm with his subject, nor feel the force of
what he says, nor produce the same effect on his readers. An
author’s style is not less a criterion of his understanding than his
sentiments. The same story told by two different persons shall, from
the difference of the manner, either set the table in a roar, or not
relax a feature in the whole company. We sometimes complain
(perhaps rather unfairly) that particular persons possess more vivacity
than wit. But we ought to take into the account, that their very
vivacity arises from their enjoying the joke; and their humouring a
story by drollery of gesture or archness of look, shews only that they
are acquainted with the different ways in which the sense of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>ludicrous expresses itself. It is not the mere dry jest, but the relish
which the person himself has of it, with which we sympathise. For
in all that tends to pleasure and excitement, the capacity for enjoyment
is the principal point. One of the most pleasant and least
tiresome persons of our acquaintance is a humourist, who has three
or four quaint witticisms and proverbial phrases, which he always
repeats over and over; but he does this with just the same vivacity
and freshness as ever, so that you feel the same amusement with less
effort than if he had startled his hearers with a succession of original
conceits. Another friend of ours, who never fails to give vent to
one or two real <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu-d’esprits</span></i> every time you meet him, from the pain
with which he is delivered of them, and the uneasiness he seems to
suffer all the rest of the time, makes a much more interesting than
comfortable companion. If you see a person in pain for himself, it
naturally puts you in pain for him. The art of pleasing consists in
being pleased. To be amiable is to be satisfied with one’s self and
others. Good-humour is essential to pleasantry. It is this circumstance,
among others, that renders the wit of Rabelais so much more
delightful than that of Swift, who, with all his satire, is ‘as dry as
the remainder biscuit after a voyage.’ In society, good-temper and
animal spirits are nearly everything. They are of more importance
than sallies of wit, or refinements of understanding. They give a
general tone of cheerfulness and satisfaction to the company. The
French have the advantage over us in external manners. They
breathe a lighter air, and have a brisker circulation of the blood.
They receive and communicate their impressions more freely.
The interchange of ideas costs them less. Their constitutional
gaiety is a kind of natural intoxication, which does not require
any other stimulus. The English are not so well off in this
respect; and <em>Falstaff’s</em> commendation on sack was evidently intended
for his countrymen,—whose ‘learning is often a mere hoard of
gold kept by a devil, till wine commences it, and sets it in act
and use.’<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> More undertakings fail for want of spirit than for
want of sense. Confidence gives a fool the advantage over a wise
man. In general, a strong passion for any object will ensure
success, for the desire of the end will point out the means. We
apprehend that people usually complain, without reason, of not succeeding
in various pursuits according to their deserts. Such persons, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>will grant, may have great merit in all other respects; but in that in
which they fail, it will almost invariably hold true, that they do not
deserve to succeed. For instance, a person who has spent his life
in thinking will acquire a habit of reflection; but he will neither
become a dancer nor a singer, rich nor beautiful. In like manner,
if any one complains of not succeeding in affairs of gallantry, we will
venture to say, it is because he is not gallant. He has mistaken his
talent—that’s all. If any person of exquisite sensibility makes love
awkwardly, it is because he does not feel it as he should. One of
these disappointed sentimentalists may very probably feel it upon
reflection, may brood over it till he has worked himself up to a pitch
of frenzy, and write his mistress the finest love-letters in the world,
in her absence; but, be assured, he does not feel an atom of this
passion in her presence. If, in paying her a compliment, he frowns
with more than usual severity, or, in presenting her with a bunch of
flowers, seems as if he was going to turn his back upon her, he can
only expect to be laughed at for his pains; nor can he plead an
excess of feeling as an excuse for want of common sense. She may
say, ‘It is not with me you are in love, but with the ridiculous
chimeras of your own brain. You are thinking of <em>Sophia Western</em>,
or some other heroine, and not of me. Go and make love to your
romances.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Chesterfield’s character of the Duke of Marlborough is a
good illustration of his general theory. He says, ‘Of all the men
I ever knew in my life, (and I knew him extremely well), the late
Duke of Marlborough possessed the graces in the highest degree,
not to say engrossed them; for I will venture (contrary to the
custom of profound historians, who always assign deep causes for
great events) to ascribe the better half of the Duke of Marlborough’s
greatness and riches to those graces. He was eminently illiterate;
wrote bad English, and spelt it worse. He had no share of what
is commonly called parts; that is, no brightness, nothing shining in
his genius. He had most undoubtedly an excellent good plain
understanding with sound judgment. But these alone would probably
have raised him but something higher than they found him,
which was page to King James <span class='fss'>II.</span>‘s Queen. There the Graces
protected and promoted him; for while he was Ensign of the Guards,
the Duchess of Cleveland, then favourite mistress of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>,
struck by these very graces, gave him £5000, with which he immediately
bought an annuity of £500 a year, which was the foundation
of his subsequent fortune. His figure was beautiful, but his manner
was irresistible by either man or woman. It was by this engaging,
graceful manner, that he was enabled, during all his wars, to connect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>the various and jarring powers of the grand alliance, and to carry
them on to the main object of the war, notwithstanding their private
and separate views, jealousies, and wrongheadedness. Whatever
court he went to (and he was often obliged to go himself to some
resty and refractory ones), he as constantly prevailed, and brought
them into his measures.’<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Grace in women has more effect than beauty. We sometimes
see a certain fine self-possession, an habitual voluptuousness of character,
which reposes on its own sensations, and derives pleasure from
all around it, that is more irresistible than any other attraction.
There is an air of languid enjoyment in such persons, ‘in their eyes,
in their arms, and their hands, and their faces,’ which robs us of ourselves,
and draws us by a secret sympathy towards them. Their
minds are a shrine where pleasure reposes. Their smile diffuses a
sensation like the breath of spring. Petrarch’s description of Laura
answers exactly to this character, which is indeed the Italian character.
Titian’s portraits are full of it: they seem sustained by
sentiment, or as if the persons whom he painted sat to music. There
is one in the Louvre (or there was) which had the most of this
expression we ever remember. It did not look downward; ‘it
looked forward, beyond this world.’ It was a look that never passed
away, but remained unalterable as the deep sentiment which gave
birth to it. It is the same constitutional character (together with
infinite activity of mind) which has enabled the greatest man in
modern history to bear his reverses of fortune with gay magnanimity,
and to submit to the loss of the empire of the world with as little
discomposure as if he had been playing a game at chess.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grace has been defined as the outward expression of the inward
harmony of the soul. Foreigners have more of this than the English,—particularly
the people of the southern and eastern countries.
Their motions appear (like the expression of their countenances) to
have a more immediate communication with their feelings. The
inhabitants of the northern climates, compared with these children
of the sun, are like hard inanimate machines, with difficulty set in
motion. A strolling gipsy will offer to tell your fortune with a grace
and an insinuation of address that would be admired in a court.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Hindoos that we see about the streets are another example of this.
They are a different race of people from ourselves. They wander
about in a luxurious dream. They are like part of a glittering procession,—like
revellers in some gay carnival. Their life is a dance,
a measure; they hardly seem to tread the earth, but are borne along
in some more genial element, and bask in the radiance of brighter
suns. We may understand this difference of climate by recollecting
the difference of our own sensations at different times, in the fine
glow of summer, or when we are pinched and dried up by a northeast
wind. Even the foolish Chinese, who go about twirling their
fans and their windmills, shew the same delight in them as the children
they collect around them. The people of the East make it
their business to sit and think and do nothing. They indulge in
endless reverie; for the incapacity of enjoyment does not impose on
them the necessity of action. There is a striking example of this
passion for castle-building in the story of the glass-man in the Arabian
Nights.</p>

<p class='c000'>After all, we would not be understood to say that manner is every
thing. Nor would we put Euclid or Sir Isaac Newton on a level
with the first <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maître</span></i> we might happen to meet. We consider
<cite>Æsop’s Fables</cite> to have been a greater work of genius than Fontaine’s
translation of them; though we doubt whether we should not prefer
Fontaine, for his style only, to Gay, who has shewn a great deal of
original invention. The elegant manners of people of fashion have
been objected to us to shew the frivolity of external accomplishments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and the facility with which they are acquired. As to the last point,
we demur. There is no class of people who lead so laborious a life,
or who take more pains to cultivate their minds as well as persons,
than people of fashion. A young lady of quality, who has to devote
so many hours a day to music, so many to dancing, so many to
drawing, so many to French, Italian, etc., certainly does not pass her
time in idleness; and these accomplishments are afterwards called into
action by every kind of external or mental stimulus, by the excitements
of pleasure, vanity, and interest. A Ministerial or Opposition lord goes
through more drudgery than half a dozen literary hacks; nor does a
reviewer by profession read half the same number of productions as a
modern fine lady is obliged to labour through. We confess, however,
we are not competent judges of the degree of elegance or refinement
implied in the general tone of fashionable manners. The successful
experiment made by <em>Peregrine Pickle</em>, in introducing his strolling
mistress into genteel company, does not redound greatly to their
credit. In point of elegance of external appearance, we see no
difference between women of fashion and women of a different character,
who dress in the same style.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 13.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON THE TENDENCY OF SECTS&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Sep. 10, 1815.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>There is a natural tendency in sects to narrow the mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extreme stress laid upon differences of minor importance, to
the neglect of more general truths and broader views of things, gives
an inverted bias to the understanding; and this bias is continually
increased by the eagerness of controversy, and captious hostility to
the prevailing system. A party-feeling of this kind once formed will
insensibly communicate itself to other topics; and will be too apt to
lead its votaries to a contempt for the opinions of others, a jealousy of
every difference of sentiment, and a disposition to arrogate all sound
principle as well as understanding to themselves, and those who think
with them. We can readily conceive how such persons, from fixing
too high a value on the practical pledge which they have given of the
independence and sincerity of their opinions, come at last to entertain a
suspicion of every one else as acting under the shackles of prejudice
or the mask of hypocrisy. All those who have not given in their
unqualified protest against received doctrines and established authority,
are supposed to labour under an acknowledged incapacity to form a
rational determination on any subject whatever. Any argument, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>having the presumption of singularity in its favour, is immediately set
aside as nugatory. There is, however, no prejudice so strong as that
which arises from a fancied exemption from all prejudice. For this
last implies not only the practical conviction that it is right, but the
theoretical assumption that it cannot be wrong. From considering all
objections as in this manner ‘null and void,’ the mind becomes so
thoroughly satisfied with its own conclusions, as to render any further
examination of them superfluous, and confounds its exclusive pretensions
to reason with the absolute possession of it. Those who, from
their professing to submit everything to the test of reason, have
acquired the name of rational Dissenters, have their weak sides as
well as other people: nor do we know of any class of disputants more
disposed to take their opinions for granted, than those who call themselves
Freethinkers. A long habit of objecting to every thing establishes
a monopoly in the right of contradiction; a prescriptive title to
the privilege of starting doubts and difficulties in the common belief,
without being liable to have our own called in question. There cannot
be a more infallible way to prove that we must be in the right,
than by maintaining roundly that every one else is in the wrong!
Not only the opposition of sects to one another, but their unanimity
among themselves, strengthens their confidence in their peculiar
notions. They feel themselves invulnerable behind the double fence
of sympathy with themselves, and antipathy to the rest of the world.
Backed by the zealous support of their followers, they become equally
intolerant with respect to the opinions of others, and tenacious of their
own. They fortify themselves within the narrow circle of their
new-fangled prejudices; the whole exercise of their right of private
judgment is after a time reduced to the repetition of a set of watchwords,
which have been adopted as the Shiboleth of the party; and
their extremest points of faith pass as current as the beadroll and
legends of the Catholics, or St. Athanasius’s Creed, and the Thirty-nine
Articles. We certainly are not going to recommend the establishment
of articles of faith, or implicit assent to them, as favourable
to the progress of philosophy; but neither has the spirit of opposition
to them this tendency, as far as relates to its immediate effects, however
useful it may be in its remote consequences. The spirit of
controversy substitutes the irritation of personal feeling for the independent
exertion of the understanding; and when this irritation ceases,
the mind flags for want of a sufficient stimulus to urge it on. It discharges
all its energy with its spleen. Besides, this perpetual cavilling
with the opinions of others, detecting petty flaws in their arguments,
calling them to a literal account for their absurdities, and squaring
their doctrines by a pragmatical standard of our own, is necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>adverse to any great enlargement of mind, or original freedom of
thought.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a> The constant attention bestowed on a few contested points,
by at once flattering our pride, our prejudices, and our indolence,
supersedes more general inquiries; and the bigoted controversialist,
by dint of repeating a certain formula of belief, shall not only convince
himself that all those who differ from him are undoubtedly
wrong on that point, but that their knowledge on all others
must be comparatively slight and superficial. We have known
some very worthy and well-informed biblical critics, who, by
virtue of having discovered that one was not three, or that the same
body could not be in two places at once, would be disposed to treat
the whole Council of Trent, with Father Paul at their head, with
very little deference, and to consider Leo <span class='fss'>X.</span> with all his court, as no
better than drivellers. Such persons will hint to you, as an additional
proof of his genius, that Milton was a non-conformist, and will
excuse the faults of Paradise Lost, as Dr. Johnson magnified them,
because the author was a republican. By the all-sufficiency of their
merits in believing certain truths which have been ‘hid from ages,’
they are elevated, in their own imagination, to a higher sphere of
intellect, and are released from the necessity of pursuing the more
ordinary tracks of inquiry. Their faculties are imprisoned in a few
favourite dogmas, and they cannot break through the trammels of a
sect. Hence we may remark a hardness and setness in the ideas of
those who have been brought up in this way, an aversion to those
finer and more delicate operations of the intellect, of taste and genius,
which require greater flexibility and variety of thought, and do not
afford the same opportunity for dogmatical assertion and controversial
cabal. The distaste of the Puritans, Quakers, etc. to pictures,
music, poetry, and the fine arts in general, may be traced to this
source as much as to their affected disdain of them, as not sufficiently
spiritual and remote from the gross impurity of sense.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We learn from the interest we take in things, and according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the number of things in which we take an interest. Our ignorance
of the real value of different objects and pursuits, will in general keep
pace with our contempt for them. To set out with denying common
sense to every one else, is not the way to be wise ourselves; nor shall
we be likely to learn much, if we suppose that no one can teach us
any thing worth knowing. Again, a contempt for the habits and
manners of the world is as prejudicial as a contempt for their opinions.
A puritanical abhorrence of every thing that does not fall in with our
immediate prejudices and customs, must effectually cut us off, not only
from a knowledge of the world and of human nature, but of good
and evil, of vice and virtue; at least, if we can credit the assertion
of Plato, (which, to some degree, we do), that the knowledge of
every thing implies the knowledge of its opposite. ‘There is some
soul of goodness in things evil.’ A most respectable sect among
ourselves (we mean the Quakers) have carried this system of negative
qualities nearly to perfection. They labour diligently, and with great
success, to exclude all ideas from their minds which they might have
in common with others. On the principle that evil communications
corrupt good manners, they retain a virgin purity of understanding,
and laudable ignorance of all liberal arts and sciences; they take
every precaution, and keep up a perpetual quarantine against the
infection of other people’s vices—or virtues; they pass through the
world like figures cut out of pasteboard or wood, turning neither to
the right nor the left; and their minds are no more affected by the
example of the follies, the pursuits, the pleasures, or the passions of
mankind, than the clothes which they wear. Their ideas want
<em>airing</em>; they are the worse for not being used: for fear of soiling
them, they keep them folded up and laid by in a sort of mental
clothes-press, through the whole of their lives. They take their
notions on trust from one generation to another, (like the scanty cut
of their coats), and are so wrapped up in these traditional maxims,
and so pin their faith on them, that one of the most intelligent of
this class of people, not long ago, assured us that ‘war was a thing
that was going quite out of fashion’! This abstract sort of existence
may have its advantages, but it takes away all the ordinary sources
of a moral imagination, as well as strength of intellect. Interest is
the only link that connects them with the world. We can understand
the high enthusiasm and religious devotion of monks and
anchorites, who gave up the world and its pleasures to dedicate
themselves to a sublime contemplation of a future state. But the sect
of the Quakers, who have transplanted the maxims of the desert into
manufacturing towns and populous cities, who have converted the
solitary cells of the religious orders into counting-houses, their beads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>into ledgers, and keep a regular debtor and creditor account
between this world and the next, puzzle us mightily! The Dissenter
is not vain, but conceited: that is, he makes up by his own
good opinion for the want of the cordial admiration of others. But
this often stands their self-love in so good stead that they need not
envy their dignified opponents who repose on lawn sleeves and ermine.
The unmerited obloquy and dislike to which they are exposed has
made them cold and reserved in their intercourse with society. The
same cause will account for the dryness and general homeliness of
their style. They labour under a sense of the want of public sympathy.
They pursue truth, for its own sake, into its private recesses
and obscure corners. They have to dig their way along a narrow
under-ground passage. It is not their object to shine; they have
none of the usual incentives of vanity, light, airy, and ostentatious.
Archiepiscopal Sees and mitres do not glitter in their distant horizon.
They are not wafted on the wings of fancy, fanned by the breath of
popular applause. The voice of the world, the tide of opinion, is
not with them. They do not therefore aim at <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i>, at outward
pomp and shew. They have a plain ground to work upon, and they
do not attempt to embellish it with idle ornaments. It would be in
vain to strew the flowers of poetry round the borders of the Unitarian
controversy.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one quality common to all sectaries, and that is, a principle
of strong fidelity. They are the safest partisans, and the steadiest
friends. Indeed, they are almost the only people who have any idea
of an abstract attachment either to a cause or to individuals, from a
sense of duty, independently of prosperous or adverse circumstances,
and in spite of opposition.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 14.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON JOHN BUNCLE&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Sept. 17, 1815.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'><em>John Buncle</em> is the English <em>Rabelais</em>. This is an author with whom,
perhaps, many of our readers are not acquainted, and whom we therefore
wish to introduce to their notice. As most of our countrymen
delight in English Generals and in English Admirals, in English
Courtiers and in English Kings, so our great delight is in English
authors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The soul of Francis Rabelais passed into John Amory, the author
of <cite>The Life and Adventures of John Buncle</cite>. Both were physicians,
and enemies of too much gravity. Their great business was to enjoy
life. Rabelais indulges his spirit of sensuality in wine, in dried neats’
tongues, in Bologna sausages, in botargos. John Buncle shews the
same symptoms of inordinate satisfaction in tea and bread and butter.
While Rabelais roared with Friar John and the Monks, John Buncle
gossiped with the ladies; and with equal and uncontrolled gaiety.
These two authors possessed all the insolence of health, so that their
works give a fillip to the constitution; but they carried off the
exuberance of their natural spirits in different ways. The title of one
of Rabelais’ chapters (and the contents answer to the title) is—‘How
they chirped over their cups.’ The title of a corresponding chapter
in John Buncle would run thus: ‘The author is invited to spend the
evening with the divine Miss Hawkins, and goes accordingly, with the
delightful conversation that ensued.’ Natural philosophers are said to
extract sun-beams from ice: our author has performed the same feat upon
the cold, quaint subtleties of theology. His constitutional alacrity overcomes
every obstacle. He converts the thorns and briars of controversial
divinity into a bed of roses. He leads the most refined and
virtuous of their sex through the mazes of inextricable problems with
the air of a man walking a minuet in a drawing-room; mixes up in
the most natural and careless manner the academy of compliments
with the rudiments of algebra; or passes with rapturous indifference
from the First of St. John and a disquisition on the Logos, to the no
less metaphysical doctrines of the principle of self-preservation, or the
continuation of the species. <em>John Buncle</em> is certainly one of the
most singular productions in the language; and herein lies its peculiarity.
It is a Unitarian romance; and one in which the soul and body are
equally attended to. The hero is a great philosopher, mathematician,
anatomist, chemist, philologist, and divine, with a good appetite, the
best spirits, and an amorous constitution, who sets out on a series of
strange adventures to propagate his philosophy, his divinity, and his
species, and meets with a constant succession of accomplished females,
adorned with equal beauty, wit, and virtue, who are always ready to
discuss all kinds of theoretical and practical points with him. His
angels (and all his women are angels) have all taken their degrees in
more than one science: love is natural to them. He is sure to
find</p>

      <div class='line'>‘A mistress and a saint in every grove.’</div>

<p class='c000'>Pleasure and business, wisdom and mirth, take their turns with the most
agreeable regularity. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A jocis ad seria, in seriis vicissim ad jocos transire.</span></i>
After a chapter of calculations in fluxions, or on the descent of tongues,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the lady and gentleman fall from Platonics to hoydening, in a manner
as truly edifying as anything in the scenes of Vanbrugh or Sir George
Etherege. No writer ever understood so well the art of relief. The
effect is like travelling in Scotland, and coming all of a sudden to
a spot of habitable ground. His mode of making love is admirable.
He takes it quite easily, and never thinks of a refusal. His success
gives him confidence, and his confidence gives him success. For
example: in the midst of one of his rambles in the mountains of
Cumberland, he unexpectedly comes to an elegant country-seat, where,
walking on the lawn with a book in her hand, he sees a most enchanting
creature, the owner of the mansion: our hero is on fire,
leaps the ha-ha which separates them, presents himself before the lady
with an easy but respectful air, begs to know the subject of her
meditation, they enter into conversation, mutual explanations take
place, a declaration of love is made, and the wedding-day is fixed
for the following Tuesday. Our author now leads a life of perfect
happiness with his beautiful Miss Noel, in a charming solitude, for a
few weeks; till, on his return from one of his rambles in the mountains,
he finds her a corpse. He ‘<em>sits with his eyes shut for seven
days</em>,’ absorbed in silent grief; he then bids adieu to melancholy
reflections, not being one of that sect of philosophers who think that
‘man was made to mourn,’—takes horse and sets out for the nearest
watering-place. As he alights at the first inn on the road, a lady
dressed in a rich green riding-habit steps out of a coach, John
Buncle hands her into the inn, they drink tea together, they converse,
they find an exact harmony of sentiment, a declaration of love follows
as a matter of course, and that day week they are married. Death,
however, contrives to keep up the ball for him; he marries seven
wives in succession, and buries them all. In short, John Buncle’s
gravity sat upon him with the happiest indifference possible. He
danced the hays with religion and morality with the ease of
a man of fashion and of pleasure. He was determined to see fair-play
between grace and nature, between his immortal and his mortal
part, and in case of any difficulty, upon the principle of ‘first come,
first served,’ made sure of the present hour. We sometimes suspect
him of a little hypocrisy, but upon a closer inspection, it appears to be
only an affectation of hypocrisy. His fine constitution comes to his
relief, and floats him over the shoals and quicksands that lie in his
way, ‘most dolphin-like.’ You see him from mere happiness of
nature chuckling with inward satisfaction in the midst of his periodical
penances, his grave grimaces, his death’s-heads, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento moris</span></i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>As men make use of olives to give a relish to their wine, so John
Buncle made use of philosophy to give a relish to life. He stops in a
ball-room at Harrowgate to moralise on the small number of faces that
appeared there out of those he remembered some years before: all
were gone whom he saw at a still more distant period; but this casts
no damper on his spirits, and he only dances the longer and better for
it. He suffers nothing unpleasant to remain long upon his mind.
He gives, in one place, a miserable description of two emaciated
valetudinarians whom he met at an inn, supping a little mutton-broth
with difficulty, but he immediately contrasts himself with them in
fine relief. ‘While I beheld things with astonishment, the servant,’
he says, ‘brought in dinner—a pound of rump-steaks and a quart of
green peas, two cuts of bread, a tankard of strong beer, and a pint
of port-wine; <em>with a fine appetite, I soon despatched my mess, and
over my wine, to help digestion, began to sing the following lines</em>!’
The astonishment of the two strangers was now as great as his own
had been.</p>

<p class='c000'>We wish to enable our readers to judge for themselves of the style
of our whimsical moralist, but are at a loss what to chuse—whether
his account of his man O’Fin; or of his friend Tom Fleming; or of
his being chased over the mountains by robbers, ‘whisking before them
like the wind away,’ as if it were high sport; or his address to the
Sun, which is an admirable piece of serious eloquence; or his character
of six Irish gentlemen, Mr. Gollogher, Mr. Gallaspy, Mr. Dunkley,
Mr. Makins, Mr. Monaghan, and Mr. O’Keefe, the last ‘descended
from the Irish kings, and first cousin to the great O’Keefe, who was
buried not long ago in Westminster Abbey.’ He professes to give
an account of these Irish gentlemen, ‘for the honour of Ireland, and
as they were curiosities of the human kind.’ Curiosities, indeed, but
not so great as their historian!</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Mr. Makins was the only one of the set who was not tall and
handsome. He was a very low, thin man, not four feet high,
and had but one eye, with which he squinted most shockingly. But
as he was matchless on the fiddle, sung well, and chatted agreeably,
he was a favourite with the ladies. They preferred ugly Makins
(as he was called) to many very handsome men. He was a
Unitarian.’</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Mr. Monaghan was an honest and charming fellow. This gentleman
and Mr. Dunkley married ladies they fell in love with at
Harrowgate Wells; Dunkley had the fair Alcmena, Miss Cox of
Northumberland; and Monaghan, Antiope with haughty charms,
Miss Pearson of Cumberland. They lived very happy many years,
and their children, I hear, are settled in Ireland.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Gentle reader, here is the character of Mr. Gallaspy:</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Gallaspy was the tallest and strongest man I have ever seen, well
made, and very handsome: had wit and abilities, sung well, and
talked with great sweetness and fluency, but was so extremely wicked
that it were better for him if he had been a natural fool. By his vast
strength and activity, his riches and eloquence, few things could withstand
him. He was the most profane swearer I have known: fought
every thing, whored every thing, and drank seven in hand: that is,
seven glasses so placed between the fingers of his right hand, that, in
drinking, the liquor fell into the next glasses, and thereby he drank
out of the first glass seven glasses at once. This was a common
thing, I find from a book in my possession, in the reign of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>,
in the madness that followed the restoration of that profligate and
worthless prince.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> But this gentleman was the only man I ever saw
who could or would attempt to do it; and he made but one gulp of
whatever he drank. He did not swallow a fluid like other people,
but if it was a quart, poured it in as from pitcher to pitcher. When
he smoked tobacco, he always blew two pipes at once, one at each
corner of his mouth, and threw the smoke out at both his nostrils. He
had killed two men in duels before I left Ireland, and would have
been hanged, but that it was his good fortune to be tried before a
judge who never let any man suffer for killing another in this manner.
(This was the late Sir John St. Leger.) He debauched all the
women he could, and many whom he could not corrupt....’ The
rest of this passage would, we fear, be too rich for the Round
Table, as we cannot insert it, in the manner of Mr. Buncle, in a
sandwich of theology. Suffice it to say, that the candour is greater
than the candour of Voltaire’s <cite>Candide</cite>, and the modesty equal to
Colley Cibber’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>To his friend Mr. Gollogher, he consecrates the following irresistible
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit souvenir</span></i>:</p>

<p class='c000'>‘He might, if he had pleased, have married any one of the most
illustrious and richest women in the kingdom; but he had an aversion
to matrimony, and could not bear the thoughts of a wife. Love and
a bottle were his taste: he was, however, the most honourable of
men in his amours, and never abandoned any woman in distress, as too
many men of fortune do, when they have gratified desire. All the
distressed were ever sharers in Mr. Gollogher’s fine estate, and
especially the girls he had taken to his breast. He provided happily
for them all, and left nineteen daughters he had by several women, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>thousand pounds each. This was acting with a temper worthy of a
man; <em>and to the memory of the benevolent Tom Gollogher, I devote this
memorandum</em>.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Lest our readers should form rather a coarse idea of our author
from the foregoing passages, we will conclude with another list of
friends in a different style:</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The Conniving-house (as the gentlemen of Trinity called it in
my time, and long after) was a little public-house, kept by Jack
Macklean, about a quarter of a mile beyond Rings-end, on the top
of the beach, within a few yards of the sea. Here we used to have
the finest fish at all times; and, in the season, green peas, and all the
most excellent vegetables. The ale here was always extraordinary,
and everything the best; which, with its delightful situation, rendered
it a delightful place of a summer’s evening. Many a delightful evening
have I passed in this pretty thatched house with the famous Larry
Grogan, who played on the bagpipes extremely well; dear Jack
Lattin, matchless on the fiddle, and the most agreeable of companions;
that ever-charming young fellow, Jack Wall, the most worthy, the
most ingenious, the most engaging of men, the son of Counsellor
Maurice Wall; and many other delightful fellows, who went in the
days of their youth to the shades of eternity. When I think of them
and their evening songs—‘<em>We will go to Johnny Macklean’s, to try if
his ale be good or no</em>,’ etc. and that years and infirmities begin to
oppress me—What is life!’</p>

<p class='c000'>We have another English author, very different from the last
mentioned one, but equal in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>, and in the perfect display of
personal character; we mean Isaac Walton, who wrote the <cite>Complete
Angler</cite>. That well-known work has an extreme simplicity, and an
extreme interest, arising out of its very simplicity. In the description
of a fishing tackle you perceive the piety and humanity of the author’s
mind. This is the best pastoral in the language, not excepting Pope’s
or Philips’s. We doubt whether Sannazarius’s <cite>Piscatory Eclogues</cite> are
equal to the scenes described by Walton on the banks of the River
Lea. He gives the feeling of the open air. We walk with him
along the dusty roadside, or repose on the banks of the river under a
shady tree, and in watching for the finny prey, imbibe what he
beautifully calls ‘the patience and simplicity of poor, honest fishermen.’
We accompany them to their inn at night, and partake of their simple
but delicious fare, while Maud, the pretty milkmaid, at her mother’s
desire, sings the classical ditties of Sir Walter Raleigh. Good cheer
is not neglected in this work, any more than in <em>John Buncle</em>, or any
other history which sets a proper value on the good things of life.
The prints in the <cite>Complete Angler</cite> give an additional reality and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>interest to the scenes it describes. While Tottenham Cross shall
stand, and longer, thy work, amiable and happy old man, shall last!<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The first Methodist on record was David. He was the first eminent
person we read of, who made a regular compromise between religion
and morality, between faith and good works. After any trifling
peccadillo in point of conduct, as a murder, adultery, perjury, or the
like, he ascended with his harp into some high tower of his palace;
and having chaunted, in a solemn strain of poetical inspiration, the
praises of piety and virtue, made his peace with heaven and his own
conscience. This extraordinary genius, in the midst of his personal
errors, retained the same lofty abstract enthusiasm for the favourite
objects of his contemplation; the character of the poet and the
prophet remained unimpaired by the vices of the man—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Pure in the last recesses of the mind’;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and the best test of the soundness of his principles and the elevation of
his sentiments, is, that they were proof against his practice. The
Gnostics afterwards maintained, that it was no matter what a man’s
actions were, so that his understanding was not debauched by them—so
that his opinions continued uncontaminated, and <em>his heart</em>, as the
phrase is, <em>right towards God</em>. Strictly speaking, this sect (whatever
name it might go by) is as old as human nature itself; for it has
existed ever since there was a contradiction between the passions
and the understanding—between what we are, and what we desire
to be. The principle of Methodism is nearly allied to hypocrisy,
and almost unavoidably slides into it: yet it is not the same thing;
for we can hardly call any one a hypocrite, however much at variance
his professions and his actions, who really wishes to be what he would
be thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jewish bard, whom we have placed at the head of this class
of devotees, was of a sanguine and robust temperament. Whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>he chose ‘to sinner it or saint it,’ he did both most royally, with a
fulness of gusto, and carried off his penances and his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux-pas</span></i> in a
style of oriental grandeur. This is by no means the character of his
followers among ourselves, who are a most pitiful set. They may
rather be considered as a collection of religious invalids; as the refuse
of all that is weak and unsound in body and mind. To speak of
them as they deserve, they are not well in the flesh, and therefore
they take refuge in the spirit; they are not comfortable here, and
they seek for the life to come; they are deficient in steadiness of
moral principle, and they trust to grace to make up the deficiency;
they are dull and gross in apprehension, and therefore they are glad
to substitute faith for reason, and to plunge in the dark, under the
supposed sanction of superior wisdom, into every species of mystery
and jargon. This is the history of Methodism, which may be defined
to be religion with its slobbering-bib and go-cart. It is a bastard
kind of Popery, stripped of its painted pomp and outward ornaments,
and reduced to a state of pauperism. ‘The whole need not a physician.’
Popery owed its success to its constant appeal to the senses
and to the weaknesses of mankind. The Church of England deprives
the Methodists of the pride and pomp of the Romish Church; but
it has left open to them the appeal to the indolence, the ignorance,
and the vices of the people; and the secret of the success of the
Catholic faith and evangelical preaching is the same—both are a
religion by proxy. What the one did by auricular confession, absolution,
penance, pictures, and crucifixes, the other does, even more
compendiously, by grace, election, faith without works, and words
without meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, the same reason makes a man a religious enthusiast
that makes a man an enthusiast in any other way, an uncomfortable
mind in an uncomfortable body. Poets, authors, and artists
in general, have been ridiculed for a pining, puritanical, poverty-struck
appearance, which has been attributed to their real poverty. But it
would perhaps be nearer the truth to say, that their being poets,
artists, etc. has been owing to their original poverty of spirit and
weakness of constitution. As a general rule, those who are dissatisfied
with themselves, will seek to go out of themselves into an ideal world.
Persons in strong health and spirits, who take plenty of air and
exercise, who are ‘in favour with their stars,’ and have a thorough
relish of the good things of this life, seldom devote themselves in
despair to religion or the Muses. Sedentary, nervous, hypochondriacal
people, on the contrary, are forced, for want of an appetite
for the real and substantial, to look out for a more airy food and
speculative comforts. ‘Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>A journeyman sign-painter, whose lungs have imbibed too great a
quantity of the effluvia of white-lead, will be seized with a fantastic
passion for the stage; and <em>Mawworm</em>, tired of standing behind his
counter, was eager to mount a tub, mistaking the suppression of his
animal spirits for the communication of the Holy Ghost!<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a> If you
live near a chapel or tabernacle in London, you may almost always
tell, from physiognomical signs, which of the passengers will turn
the corner to go there. We were once staying in a remote place
in the country, where a chapel of this sort had been erected by the
force of missionary zeal; and one morning, we perceived a long procession
of people coming from the next town to the consecration of
this same chapel. Never was there such a set of scarecrows.
Melancholy tailors, consumptive hair-dressers, squinting cobblers,
women with child or in the ague, made up the forlorn hope of the
pious cavalcade. The pastor of this half-starved flock, we confess,
came riding after, with a more goodly aspect, as if he had ‘with
sound of bell been knolled to church, and sat at good men’s feasts.’
He had in truth lately married a thriving widow, and been pampered
with hot suppers to strengthen the flesh and the spirit. We have
seen several of these ‘round fat oily men of God,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That shone all glittering with ungodly dew.”’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>They grow sleek and corpulent by getting into better pasture, but
they do not appear healthy. They retain the original sin of their
constitution, an atrabilious taint in their complexion, and do not put
a right-down, hearty, honest, good-looking face upon the matter, like
the regular clergy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, Methodism, by its leading doctrines, has a peculiar charm
for all those, who have an equal facility in sinning and repenting,—in
whom the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak,—who have neither
fortitude to withstand temptation, nor to silence the admonitions of
conscience,—who like the theory of religion better than the practice,
and who are willing to indulge in all the raptures of speculative devotion,
without being tied down to the dull, literal performance of its
duties. There is a general propensity in the human mind (even in
the most vicious) to pay virtue a distant homage; and this desire
is only checked by the fear of condemning ourselves by our own
acknowledgments. What an admirable expedient then in ‘that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>burning and shining light,’ Whitefield, and his associates, to make this
very disposition to admire and extol the highest patterns of goodness,
a substitute for, instead of an obligation to, the practice of virtue, to
allow us to be quit for ‘the vice that most easily besets us,’ by canting
lamentations over the depravity of human nature, and loud hosannahs
to the Son of David! How comfortably this doctrine must sit on
all those who are loth to give up old habits of vice, or are just tasting
the sweets of new ones; on the withered hag who looks back on
a life of dissipation, or the young devotee who looks forward to a
life of pleasure; the knavish tradesman retiring from business or
entering on it; the battered rake; the sneaking politician, who trims
between his place and his conscience, wriggling between heaven and
earth, a miserable two-legged creature, with sanctified face and fawning
gestures; the maudling sentimentalist, the religious prostitute, the
disinterested poet-laureate, the humane war-contractor, or the Society
for the Suppression of Vice! This scheme happily turns morality
into a sinecure, takes all the practical drudgery and trouble off your
hands, ‘and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words.’ Its proselytes
besiege the gates of heaven, like sturdy beggars about the doors
of the great, lie and bask in the sunshine of divine grace, sigh and
groan and bawl out for mercy, expose their sores and blotches to
excite commiseration, and cover the deformities of their nature with
a garb of borrowed righteousness!</p>

<p class='c000'>The jargon and nonsense which are so studiously inculcated in
the system, are another powerful recommendation of it to the vulgar.
It does not impose any tax upon the understanding. Its essence is
to be unintelligible. It is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</span></i> for ignorance and folly!
Those, ‘numbers without number,’ who are either unable or unwilling
to think connectedly or rationally on any subject, are at once
released from every obligation of the kind, by being told that faith
and reason are opposed to one another, and the greater the impossibility,
the greater the merit of the faith. A set of phrases which,
without conveying any distinct idea, excite our wonder, our fear, our
curiosity and desires, which let loose the imagination of the gaping
multitude, and confound and baffle common sense, are the common
stock-in-trade of the conventicle. They never stop for the distinctions
of the understanding, and have thus got the start of other sects,
who are so hemmed in with the necessity of giving reasons for their
opinions, that they cannot get on at all. ‘Vital Christianity’ is no
other than an attempt to lower all religion to the level of the capacities
of the lowest of the people. One of their favourite places of
worship combines the noise and turbulence of a drunken brawl at an
ale-house, with the indecencies of a bagnio. They strive to gain a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>vertigo by abandoning their reason, and give themselves up to the
intoxications of a distempered zeal, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Dissolves them into ecstasies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And brings all heaven before their eyes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Religion, without superstition, will not answer the purposes of
fanaticism, and we may safely say, that almost every sect of Christianity
is a perversion of its essence, to accommodate it to the prejudices
of the world. The Methodists have greased the boots of the Presbyterians,
and they have done well. While the latter are weighing
their doubts and scruples to the division of a hair, and shivering on
the narrow brink that divides philosophy from religion, the former
plunge without remorse into hell-flames, soar on the wings of divine
love, are carried away with the motions of the spirit, are lost in the
abyss of unfathomable mysteries,—election, reprobation, predestination,—and
revel in a sea of boundless nonsense. It is a gulf that
swallows up every thing. The cold, the calculating, and the dry, are
not to the taste of the many; religion is an anticipation of the preternatural
world, and it in general requires preternatural excitements
to keep it alive. If it takes a definite consistent form, it loses its
interest: to produce its effect it must come in the shape of an apparition.
Our quacks treat grown people as the nurses do children;—terrify
them with what they have no idea of, or take them to a puppet-show.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bottom the weaver is a character that has not had justice done him.
He is the most romantic of mechanics. And what a list of companions
he has—<em>Quince</em> the carpenter, <em>Snug</em> the joiner, <em>Flute</em> the
bellows-mender, <em>Snout</em> the tinker, <em>Starveling</em> the tailor; and then,
again, what a group of fairy attendants, <em>Puck</em>, <em>Peaseblossom</em>, <em>Cobweb</em>,
<em>Moth</em>, and <em>Mustard-seed</em>! It has been observed that Shakspeare’s
characters are constructed upon deep physiological principles;
and there is something in this play which looks very like it. <em>Bottom</em>
the weaver, who takes the lead of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘This crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</div>
      <div class='line'>That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>follows a sedentary trade, and he is accordingly represented as conceited,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>serious, and fantastical. He is ready to undertake any thing
and every thing, as if it was as much a matter of course as the motion
of his loom and shuttle. He is for playing the tyrant, the lover, the
lady, the lion. ‘He will roar that it shall do any man’s heart good
to hear him’; and this being objected to as improper, he still has a
resource in his good opinion of himself, and ‘will roar you an ‘twere
any nightingale.’ <em>Snug</em> the joiner is the moral man of the piece, who
proceeds by measurement and discretion in all things. You see him
with his rule and compasses in his hand. ‘Have you the lion’s part
written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.’
‘You may do it extempore,’ says <em>Quince</em>, ‘for it is nothing but
roaring.’ <em>Starveling</em> the tailor keeps the peace, and objects to the
lion and the drawn sword: ‘I believe we must leave the killing out,
when all’s done.’ <em>Starveling</em>, however, does not start the objections
himself, but seconds them when made by others, as if he had not
spirit to express his fears without encouragement. It is too much to
suppose all this intentional: but it very luckily falls out so. Nature
includes all that is implied in the most subtle and analytical distinctions;
and the same distinctions will be found in Shakspeare. <em>Bottom</em>,
who is not only chief actor, but stage-manager for the occasion, has a
device to obviate the danger of frightening the ladies: ‘Write me a
prologue, and let the prologue seem to say, we will do him no harm
with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but
Bottom the weaver; this will put them out of fear.’ <em>Bottom</em> seems
to have understood the subject of dramatic illusion at least as well
as any modern essayist. If our holiday mechanic rules the roast
among his fellows, he is no less at home in his new character of an
ass, ‘with amiable cheeks and fair large ears.’ He instinctively
acquires a most learned taste, and grows fastidious in the choice of
dried peas and bottled hay. He is quite familiar with his new
attendants, and assigns them their parts with all due gravity. ‘Monsieur
<em>Cobweb</em>, good Monsieur, get your weapon in your hand, and
kill me a red-hipt humble bee on the top of a thistle, and good
Monsieur, bring me the honey-bag.’ What an exact knowledge is
shewn here of natural history!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Puck</em> or <em>Robin Goodfellow</em> is the leader of the fairy band. He
is the <em>Ariel</em> of the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>; and yet as unlike as
can be to the <em>Ariel</em> in the <cite>Tempest</cite>. No other poet could have made
two such different characters out of the same fanciful materials and
situations. <em>Ariel</em> is a minister of retribution, who is touched with a
sense of pity at the woes he inflicts. <em>Puck</em> is a mad-cap sprite, full
of wantonness and mischief, who laughs at those whom he misleads:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>‘Lord, what fools these mortals be!’ <em>Ariel</em> cleaves the air, and
executes his mission with the zeal of a winged messenger: <em>Puck</em> is
borne along on his fairy errand, like the light and glittering gossamer
before the breeze. He is, indeed, a most Epicurean little gentleman,
dealing in quaint devices, and faring in dainty delights. <em>Prospero</em> and
his world of spirits are a set of moralists: but with <em>Oberon</em> and his
fairies we are launched at once into the empire of the butterflies.
How beautifully is this race of beings contrasted with the men and
women actors in the scene, by a single epithet which <em>Titania</em> gives to
the latter, ‘the human mortals’! It is astonishing that Shakspeare
should be considered, not only by foreigners, but by many of our own
critics, as a gloomy and heavy writer, who painted nothing but
‘Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire.’ His subtlety exceeds
that of all other dramatic writers, insomuch that a celebrated person
of the present day said, that he regarded him rather as a metaphysician
than a poet. His delicacy and sportive gaiety are infinite. In the
<cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> alone, we should imagine, there is more
sweetness and beauty of description than in the whole range of French
poetry put together. What we mean is this, that we will produce
out of that single play ten passages, to which we do not think any ten
passages in the works of the French poets can be opposed, displaying
equal fancy and imagery. Shall we mention the remonstrance of
<em>Helena</em> to <em>Hermia</em>, or <em>Titania’s</em> description of her fairy train, or her
disputes with <em>Oberon</em> about the Indian boy, or <em>Puck’s</em> account of
himself and his employments, or the Fairy Queen’s exhortation to the
elves to pay due attendance upon her favourite <em>Bottom</em>,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a> or <em>Hippolyta’s</em>
description of a chace, or <em>Theseus’s</em> answer? The two last are as
heroical and spirited, as the others are full of luscious tenderness.
The reading of this play is like wandering in a grove by moonlight:
the descriptions breathe a sweetness like odours thrown from beds of
flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Shakspeare is almost the only poet of whom it may be said, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Age cannot wither, nor custom stale</div>
      <div class='line'>His infinite variety.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>His nice touches of individual character, and marking of its different
gradations, have been often admired; but the instances have not been
exhausted, because they are inexhaustible. We will mention two
which occur to us. One is where <em>Christopher Sly</em> expresses his
approbation of the play, by saying, ‘’Tis a good piece of work, would
‘twere done,’ as if he were thinking of his Saturday night’s job.
Again, there cannot well be a finer gradation of character than that
in Henry <span class='fss'>IV.</span> between <em>Falstaff</em> and <em>Shallow</em>, and <em>Shallow</em> and <em>Silence</em>.
It seems difficult to fall lower than the Squire; but this fool, great as
he is, finds an admirer and humble foil in his cousin <em>Silence</em>. Vain of
his acquaintance with <em>Sir John</em>, who makes a butt of him, he exclaims,
‘Would, cousin <em>Silence</em>, that thou had’st seen that which this
Knight and I have seen!’ ‘Aye, master <em>Shallow</em>, we have heard
the chimes at midnight,’ says <em>Sir John</em>. The true spirit of humanity,
the thorough knowledge of the stuff we are made of, the practical
wisdom with the seeming fooleries, in the whole of this exquisite
scene, and afterwards in the dialogue on the death of old <em>Double</em>,
have no parallel anywhere else.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been suggested to us, that the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> would
do admirably to get up as a Christmas after-piece; and our prompter
proposes that Mr. Kean should play the part of <em>Bottom</em>, as worthy of
his great talents. He might offer to play the lady like any of our
actresses that he pleased, the lover or the tyrant like any of our actors
that he pleased, and the lion like ‘the most fearful wild fowl living.’
The carpenter, the tailor, and joiner, would hit the galleries. The
young ladies in love would interest the side-boxes, and <em>Robin Goodfellow</em>
and his companions excite a lively fellow-feeling in the children
from school. There would be two courts, an empire within an
empire, the Athenian and the Fairy King and Queen, with their
attendants, and with all their finery. What an opportunity for processions,
for the sound of trumpets, and glittering of spears! What
a fluttering of urchins’ painted wings; what a delightful profusion
of gauze clouds, and airy spirits floating on them! It would be a
complete English fairy tale.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>We have begun this Essay on a very coarse sheet of damaged foolscap,
and we find that we are going to write it, whether for the sake of
contrast, or from having a very fine pen, in a remarkably nice hand.
Something of a similar process seems to have taken place in Gay’s
mind, when he composed his <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite>. He chose a very
unpromising ground to work upon, and he has prided himself in
adorning it with all the graces, the precision and brilliancy of style.
It is a vulgar error to call this a vulgar play. So far from it, that we
do not scruple to declare our opinion that it is one of the most refined
productions in the language. The elegance of the composition is in
exact proportion to the coarseness of the materials: by ‘happy
alchemy of mind,’ the author has extracted an essence of refinement
from the dregs of human life, and turns its very dross into gold. The
scenes, characters, and incidents are, in themselves, of the lowest and
most disgusting kind: but, by the sentiments and reflections which
are put into the mouths of highwaymen, turnkeys, their mistresses,
wives, or daughters, he has converted this motley group into a set
of fine gentlemen and ladies, satirists and philosophers. He has also
effected this transformation without once violating probability, or
‘o’erstepping the modesty of nature.’ In fact Gay has turned the
tables on the critics; and by the assumed licence of the mock-heroic
style, has enabled himself to <em>do justice to nature</em>, that is, to give all
the force, truth, and locality of real feeling to the thoughts and
expressions, without being called to the bar of false taste and affected
delicacy. The extreme beauty and feeling of the song, ‘Woman is
like the fair flower in its lustre,’ is only equalled by its characteristic
propriety and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>. It may be said that this is taken from
Tibullus; but there is nothing about Covent Garden in Tibullus.
<em>Polly</em> describes her lover going to the gallows with the same touching
simplicity, and with all the natural fondness of a young girl in her
circumstances, who sees in his approaching catastrophe nothing but
the misfortunes and the personal accomplishments of the object of her
affections. ‘I see him sweeter than the nosegay in his hand: the
admiring crowd lament that so lovely a youth should come to an
untimely end:—even butchers weep, and Jack Ketch refuses his fee
rather than consent to tie the fatal knot.’ The preservation of the
character and costume is complete. It has been said by a great
authority, ‘There is some soul of goodness in things evil’: and the
<cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite> is a good-natured but instructive comment on this text.
The poet has thrown all the gaiety and sunshine of the imagination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>all the intoxication of pleasure, and the vanity of despair, round the
short-lived existence of his heroes; while <em>Peachum</em> and <em>Lockitt</em> are
seen in the back-ground, parcelling out their months and weeks between
them. The general view exhibited of human life, is of the most
masterly and abstracted kind. The author has, with great felicity,
brought out the good qualities and interesting emotions almost inseparable
from the lowest conditions; and with the same penetrating glance
has detected the disguises which rank and circumstances lend to
exalted vice. Every line in this sterling comedy sparkles with wit,
and is fraught with the keenest sarcasm. The very wit, however,
takes off from the offensiveness of the satire; and we have seen great
statesmen, very great statesmen, heartily enjoying the joke, laughing
most immoderately at the compliments paid to them as not much
worse than pickpockets and cut-throats in a different line of life, and
pleased, as it were, to see themselves humanised by some sort of
fellowship with their kind. Indeed, it may be said that the moral
of the piece is to show the <em>vulgarity</em> of vice; and that the same
violations of integrity and decorum, the same habitual sophistry in
palliating their want of principle, are common to the great and
powerful, with the lowest and most contemptible of the species.
What can be more convincing than the arguments used by these
would-be politicians, to shew that in hypocrisy, selfishness, and
treachery, they do not come up to many of their betters? The
exclamation of <em>Mrs. Peachum</em>, when her daughter marries <em>Macheath</em>,
‘Hussey, hussey, you will be as ill used, and as much neglected, as if
you had married a lord,’ is worth all Miss Hannah More’s laboured
invectives on the laxity of the manners of high life!<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Patriotism, in modern times, and in great states, is and must be the
creature of reason and reflection, rather than the offspring of physical
or local attachment. Our country is a complex, abstract existence,
recognised only by the understanding. It is an immense riddle, containing
numberless modifications of reason and prejudice, of thought
and passion. Patriotism is not, in a strict or exclusive sense, a
natural or personal affection, but a law of our rational and moral
nature, strengthened and determined by particular circumstances and
associations, but not born of them, nor wholly nourished by them.
It is not possible that we should have an individual attachment to
sixteen millions of men, any more than to sixty millions. We cannot
be <em>habitually</em> attached to places we never saw, and people we never
heard of. Is not the name of Englishman a general term, as well as
that of man? How many varieties does it not combine within it?
Are the opposite extremities of the globe our native place, because
they are a part of that geographical and political denomination, our
country? Does natural affection expand in circles of latitude and
longitude? What personal or instinctive sympathy has the English
peasant with the African slave-driver, or East Indian Nabob? Some
of our wretched bunglers in metaphysics would fain persuade us to
discard all general humanity, and all sense of abstract justice, as a
violation of natural affection, and yet do not see that the love of our
country itself is in the list of our general affections. The common
notions of patriotism are transmitted down to us from the savage
tribes, where the fate and condition of all was the same, or from the
states of Greece and Rome, where the country of the citizen was
the town in which he was born. Where this is no longer the case,—where
our country is no longer contained within the narrow circle of
the same walls,—where we can no longer behold its glimmering
horizon from the top of our native mountains—beyond these limits,
it is not a natural but an artificial idea, and our love of it either a
deliberate dictate of reason, or a cant term. It was said by an acute
observer, and eloquent writer (Rousseau) that the love of mankind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>was nothing but the love of justice: the same might be said, with
considerable truth, of the love of our country. It is little more than
another name for the love of liberty, of independence, of peace, and
social happiness. We do not say that other indirect and collateral
circumstances do not go to the superstructure of this sentiment (as
language,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> literature, manners, national customs), but this is the broad
and firm basis.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 19.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON BEAUTY&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Feb. 4, 1816.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It is about sixty years ago that Sir Joshua Reynolds, in three papers
which he wrote in the <cite>Idler</cite>, advanced the notion, which has prevailed
very much ever since, that Beauty was entirely dependent on
custom, or on the conformity of objects to a given standard. Now,
we could never persuade ourselves that custom, or the association of
ideas, though a very powerful, was the only principle of the preference
which the mind gives to certain objects over others. Novelty is
surely one source of pleasure; otherwise we cannot account for the
well-known epigram, beginning—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Two happy things in marriage are allowed,’ etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nor can we help thinking, that, besides custom, or the conformity of
certain objects to others of the same general class, there is also a
certain conformity of objects to themselves, a symmetry of parts, a
principle of proportion, gradation, harmony (call it what you will),
which makes certain things naturally pleasing or beautiful, and the
want of it the contrary.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will not pretend to define what Beauty is, after so many
learned authors have failed; but we shall attempt to give some
examples of what constitutes it, to shew that it is in some way
inherent in the object, and that if custom is a second nature, there
is another nature which ranks before it. Indeed, the idea that all
pleasure and pain depend on the association of ideas is manifestly
absurd: there must be something in itself pleasurable or painful, before
it could become possible for the feelings of pleasure or pain to be
transferred by association from one object to another.</p>

<p class='c000'>Regular features are generally accounted handsome; but regular
features are those, the outlines of which answer most nearly to each
other, or undergo the fewest abrupt changes. We shall attempt to
explain this idea by a reference to the Greek and African face; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>first of which is beautiful, because it is made up of lines corresponding
with or melting into each other: the last is not so, because it is made
up almost entirely of contradictory lines and sharp angular projections.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general principle of the difference between the two heads is
this: the forehead of the Greek is square and upright, and, as it
were, overhangs the rest of the face, except the nose, which is a
continuation of it almost in an even line. In the Negro or African,
the tip of the nose is the most projecting part of the face; and from
that point the features retreat back, both upwards towards the forehead,
and downwards to the chin. This last form is an approximation
to the shape of the head of the animal, as the former bears the
strongest stamp of humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Grecian nose is regular, the African irregular. In other
words, the Grecian nose seen in profile forms nearly a straight line
with the forehead, and falls into the upper lip by two curves, which
balance one another: seen in front, the two sides are nearly parallel
to each other, and the nostrils and lower part form regular curves,
answering to one another, and to the contours of the mouth. On
the contrary, the African pug-nose is more ‘like an ace of clubs.’
Whichever way you look at it, it presents the appearance of a triangle.
It is narrow, and drawn to a point at top, broad and flat at bottom.
The point is peaked, and recedes abruptly to the level of the forehead
or the mouth, and the nostrils are as if they were drawn up with
hooks towards each other. All the lines cross each other at sharp
angles. The forehead of the Greeks is flat and square, till it is
rounded at the temples; the African forehead, like the ape’s, falls
back towards the top, and spreads out at the sides, so as to form an
angle with the cheek-bones. The eyebrows of the Greeks are either
straight, so as to sustain the lower part of the tablet of the forehead,
or gently arched, so as to form the outer circle of the curves of the
eyelids. The form of the eyes gives all the appearance of orbs,
full, swelling, and involved within each other; the African eyes
are flat, narrow at the corners, in the shape of a tortoise, and the
eyebrows fly off slantwise to the sides of the forehead. The idea of
the superiority of the Greek face in this respect is admirably expressed
in Spenser’s description of Belphœbe:</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The head of the girl in the <cite>Transfiguration</cite> (which Raphael
took from the <cite>Niobe</cite>) has the same correspondence and exquisite
involution of the outline of the forehead, the eyebrows, and the eyes
(circle within circle) which we here speak of. Every part of that
delightful head is blended together, and every sharp projection
moulded and softened down, with the feeling of a sculptor, or as if
nothing should be left to offend the <em>touch</em> as well as eye. Again, the
Greek mouth is small, and little wider than the lower part of the
nose: the lips form waving lines, nearly answering to each other;
the African mouth is twice as wide as the nose, projects in front,
and falls back towards the ears—is sharp and triangular, and consists
of one protruding and one distended lip. The chin of the Greek
face is round and indented, curled in, forming a fine oval with the
outline of the cheeks, which resemble the two halves of a plane
parallel with the forehead, and rounded off like it. The Negro chin
falls inwards like a dew-lap, is nearly bisected in the middle, flat at
bottom, and joined abruptly to the rest of the face, the whole contour
of which is made up of jagged cross-grained lines. The African
physiognomy appears, indeed, splitting in pieces, starting out in every
oblique direction, and marked by the most sudden and violent changes
throughout: the whole of the Grecian face blends with itself in a
state of the utmost harmony and repose.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> There is a harmony of
expression as well as a symmetry of form. We sometimes see a face
melting into beauty by the force of sentiment—an eye that, in its
liquid mazes, for ever expanding and for ever retiring within itself,
draws the soul after it, and tempts the rash beholder to his fate.
This is, perhaps, what Werter meant, when he says of Charlotte,
‘Her full dark eyes are ever before me, like a sea, like a precipice.’
The historical in expression is the consistent and harmonious,—whatever
in thought or feeling communicates the same movement, whether
voluptuous or impassioned, to all the parts of the face, the mouth, the
eyes, the forehead, and shews that they are all actuated by the same
spirit. For this reason it has been observed, that all intellectual and
impassioned faces are historical,—the heads of philosophers, poets,
lovers, and madmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Motion is beautiful as it implies either continuity or gradual change.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The motion of a hawk is beautiful, either returning in endless circles
with suspended wings, or darting right forward in one level line upon
its prey. We have, when boys, often watched the glittering down
of the thistle, at first scarcely rising above the ground, and then,
mingling with the gale, borne into the upper sky with varying fantastic
motion. How delightful, how beautiful! All motion is beautiful
that is not contradictory to itself,—that is free from sudden jerks and
shocks,—that is either sustained by the same impulse, or gradually
reconciles different impulses together. Swans resting on the calm
bosom of a lake, in which their image is reflected, or moved up and
down with the heaving of the waves, though by this the double
image is disturbed, are equally beautiful. Homer describes Mercury
as flinging himself from the top of Olympus, and skimming the surface
of the ocean. This is lost in Pope’s translation, who suspends him
on the incumbent air. The beauty of the original image consists in
the idea which it conveys of smooth, uninterrupted speed, of the
evasion of every let or obstacle to the progress of the God.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Awkwardness
is occasioned by a difficulty in moving, or by disjointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>movements, that distract the attention and defeat each other. Grace is
the absence of every thing that indicates pain or difficulty, or hesitation
or incongruity. The only graceful dancer we ever saw was Deshayes,
the Frenchman. He came on bounding like a stag. It was not
necessary to have seen good dancing before to know that this was
really fine. Whoever has seen the sea in motion, the branches of a
tree waving in the air, would instantly perceive the resemblance.
Flexibility and grace are to be found in nature as well as at the opera.
Mr. Burke, in his Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful, has very
admirably described the bosom of a beautiful woman, almost entirely
with reference to the ideas of motion. Those outlines are beautiful
which describe pleasant motions. A fine use is made of this principle
by one of the apocryphal writers, in describing the form of the rainbow.
‘He hath set his bow in the heavens, and his hands have
bended it.’ Harmony in colour has not been denied to be a natural
property of objects, consisting in the gradations of intermediate colours.
The principle appears to be here the same as in some of the former
instances. The effect of colour in Titian’s Bath of Diana, at the
Marquis of Stafford’s, is perhaps the finest in the world, made up of
the richest contrasts, blended together by the most masterly gradations.
Harmony of sound depends apparently on the same principle as
harmony of colour. Rhyme depends on the pleasure derived from a
recurrence of similar sounds, as symmetry of features does on the
correspondence of the different outlines. The prose style of Dr.
Johnson originated in the same principle. The secret consisted in
rhyming on the sense, and balancing one half of the sentence uniformly
and systematically against the other. The Hebrew poetry
was constructed in the same manner.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 20.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON IMITATION&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Feb. 18, 1816.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Objects in themselves disagreeable or indifferent, often please in the
imitation. A brick-floor, a pewter-plate, an ugly cur barking, a
Dutch boor smoking or playing at skittles, the inside of a shambles,
a fishmonger’s or a greengrocer’s stall, have been made very interesting
as pictures by the fidelity, skill, and spirit, with which they have been
copied. One source of the pleasure thus received is undoubtedly
the surprise or feeling of admiration, occasioned by the unexpected
coincidence between the imitation and the object. The deception,
however, not only pleases at first sight, or from mere novelty; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>it continues to please upon farther acquaintance, and in proportion to
the insight we acquire into the distinctions of nature and of art. By
far the most numerous class of connoisseurs are the admirers of pictures
of <em>still life</em>, which have nothing but the elaborateness of the execution
to recommend them. One chief reason, it should seem then, why
imitation pleases, is, because, by exciting curiosity, and inviting a comparison
between the object and the representation, it opens a new field
of inquiry, and leads the attention to a variety of details and distinctions
not perceived before. This latter source of the pleasure derived
from imitation has never been properly insisted on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The anatomist is delighted with a coloured plate, conveying the
exact appearance of the progress of certain diseases, or of the internal
parts and dissections of the human body. We have known a
Jennerian Professor as much enraptured with a delineation of the
different stages of vaccination, as a florist with a bed of tulips, or an
auctioneer with a collection of Indian shells. But in this case, we
find that not only the imitation pleases,—the objects themselves give as
much pleasure to the professional inquirer, as they would pain to the
uninitiated. The learned amateur is struck with the beauty of the
coats of the stomach laid bare, or contemplates with eager curiosity
the transverse section of the brain, divided on the new Spurzheim
principles. It is here, then, the number of the parts, their distinctions,
connections, structure, uses; in short, an entire new set of
ideas, which occupies the mind of the student, and overcomes the
sense of pain and repugnance, which is the only feeling that the sight
of a dead and mangled body presents to ordinary men. It is the
same in art as in science. The painter of still life, as it is called,
takes the same pleasure in the object as the spectator does in the
imitation; because by habit he is led to perceive all those distinctions
in nature, to which other persons never pay any attention till they are
pointed out to them in the picture. The vulgar only see nature as it
is reflected to them from art; the painter sees the picture in nature,
before he transfers it to the canvass. He refines, he analyses, he
remarks fifty things, which escape common eyes; and this affords a
distinct source of reflection and amusement to him, independently of
the beauty or grandeur of the objects themselves, or of their connection
with other impressions besides those of sight. The charm of
the Fine Arts, then, does not consist in any thing peculiar to imitation,
even where only imitation is concerned, since <em>there</em>, where art exists
in the highest perfection, namely, in the mind of the artist, the
object excites the same or greater pleasure, before the imitation exists.
Imitation renders an object, displeasing in itself, a source of pleasure,
not by repetition of the same idea, but by suggesting new ideas, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>detecting new properties, and endless shades of difference, just as a
close and continued contemplation of the object itself would do.
Art shows us nature, divested of the medium of our prejudices. It
divides and decompounds objects into a thousand curious parts, which
may be full of variety, beauty, and delicacy in themselves, though
the object to which they belong may be disagreeable in its general
appearance, or by association with other ideas. A painted marigold
is inferior to a painted rose only in form and colour: it loses nothing in
point of smell. Yellow hair is perfectly beautiful in a picture. To
a person lying with his face close to the ground in a summer’s day,
the blades of spear-grass will appear like tall forest trees, shooting up
into the sky; as an insect seen through a microscope is magnified
into an elephant. Art is the microscope of the mind, which sharpens
the wit as the other does the sight; and converts every object into a
little universe in itself.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a> Art may be said to draw aside the veil from
nature. To those who are perfectly unskilled in the practice,
unimbued with the principles of art, most objects present only a confused
mass. The pursuit of art is liable to be carried to a contrary
excess, as where it produces a rage for the <em>picturesque</em>. You cannot
go a step with a person of this class, but he stops you to point out
some choice bit of landscape, or fancied improvement, and teazes
you almost to death with the frequency and insignificance of his
discoveries!</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a common opinion, (which may be worth noticing here), that
the study of physiognomy has a tendency to make people satirical,
and the knowledge of art to make them fastidious in their taste.
Knowledge may, indeed, afford a handle to ill-nature; but it takes
away the principal temptation to its exercise, by supplying the mind
with better resources against <em>ennui</em>. Idiots are always mischievous;
and the most superficial persons are the most disposed to find fault,
because they understand the fewest things. The English are more apt
than any other nation to treat foreigners with contempt, because they
seldom see anything but their own dress and manners; and it is only
in petty provincial towns that you meet with persons who pride themselves
on being satirical. In every country place in England there
are one or two persons of this description who keep the whole neighbourhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>in terror. It is not to be denied that the study of the
<em>ideal</em> in art, if separated from the study of nature, may have the effect
above stated, of producing dissatisfaction and contempt for everything
but itself, as all affectation must; but to the genuine artist,
truth, nature, beauty, are almost different names for the same
thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Imitation interests, then, by exciting a more intense perception of
truth, and calling out the powers of observation and comparison:
wherever this effect takes place the interest follows of course, with
or without the imitation, whether the object is real or artificial. The
gardener delights in the streaks of a tulip, or ‘pansy freak’d with jet’;
the mineralogist in the varieties of certain strata, because he understands
them. Knowledge is pleasure as well as power. A work of
art has in this respect no advantage over a work of nature, except
inasmuch as it furnishes an additional stimulus to curiosity. Again,
natural objects please in proportion as they are uncommon, by fixing
the attention more steadily on their beauties or differences. The
same principle of the effect of novelty in exciting the attention, may
account, perhaps, for the extraordinary discoveries and lies told by
travellers, who, opening their eyes for the first time in foreign parts,
are startled at every object they meet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why the excitement of intellectual activity pleases, is not here the
question; but that it does so, is a general and acknowledged law of
the human mind. We grow attached to the mathematics only from
finding out their truth; and their utility chiefly consists (at present)
in the contemplative pleasure they afford to the student. Lines,
points, angles, squares, and circles are not interesting in themselves;
they become so by the power of mind exerted in comprehending their
properties and relations. People dispute for ever about Hogarth.
The question has not in one respect been fairly stated. The merit
of his pictures does not so much depend on the nature of the subject,
as on the knowledge displayed of it, on the number of ideas they
excite, on the fund of thought and observation contained in them.
They are to be looked on as works of science; they gratify our love
of truth; they fill up the void of the mind: they are a series of
plates of natural history, and also of that most interesting part of
natural history, the history of man. The superiority of high art over
the common or mechanical consists in combining truth of imitation
with beauty and grandeur of subject. The historical painter is
superior to the flower-painter, because he combines or ought to combine
human interests and passions with the same power of imitating
external nature; or, indeed, with greater, for the greatest difficulty
of imitation is the power of imitating expression. The difficulty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>copying increases with our knowledge of the object; and that again
with the interest we take in it. The same argument might be applied
to shew that the poet and painter of imagination are superior to the
mere philosopher or man of science, because they exercise the powers
of reason and intellect combined with nature and passion. They treat
of the highest categories of the human soul, pleasure and pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the foregoing train of reasoning, we may easily account for
the too great tendency of art to run into pedantry and affectation.
There is ‘a pleasure in art which none but artists feel.’ They see
beauty where others see nothing of the sort, in wrinkles, deformity,
and old age. They see it in Titian’s Schoolmaster as well as in
Raphael’s Galatea; in the dark shadows of Rembrandt as well as
in the splendid colours of Rubens; in an angel’s or in a butterfly’s
wings. They see with different eyes from the multitude. But true
genius, though it has new sources of pleasure opened to it, does not
lose its sympathy with humanity. It combines truth of imitation with
effect, the parts with the whole, the means with the end. The
mechanic artist sees only that which nobody else sees, and is conversant
only with the technical language and difficulties of his art. A
painter, if shewn a picture, will generally dwell upon the academic
skill displayed in it, and the knowledge of the received rules of composition.
A musician, if asked to play a tune, will select that which
is the most difficult and the least intelligible. The poet will be struck
with the harmony of versification, or the elaborateness of the arrangement
in a composition. The conceits in Shakspeare were his greatest
delight; and improving upon this perverse method of judging, the
German writers, Goethe and Schiller, look upon Werter and The
Robbers as the worst of all their works, because they are the most
popular. Some artists among ourselves have carried the same principle
to a singular excess.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> If professors themselves are liable to this
kind of pedantry, connoisseurs and dilettanti, who have less sensibility
and more affectation, are almost wholly swayed by it. They see
nothing in a picture but the execution. They are proud of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>knowledge in proportion as it is a secret. The worst judges of pictures
in the United Kingdom are, first, picture-dealers; next, perhaps, the
Directors of the British Institution; and after them, in all probability,
the Members of the Royal Academy.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 21.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON <em>GUSTO</em>&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>May 26, 1816.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Gusto in art is power or passion defining any object. It is not so
difficult to explain this term in what relates to expression (of which
it may be said to be the highest degree) as in what relates to things
without expression, to the natural appearances of objects, as mere
colour or form. In one sense, however, there is hardly any object
entirely devoid of expression, without some character of power belonging
to it, some precise association with pleasure or pain: and it is in
giving this truth of character from the truth of feeling, whether in the
highest or the lowest degree, but always in the highest degree of which
the subject is capable, that gusto consists.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a gusto in the colouring of Titian. Not only do his heads
seem to think—his bodies seem to feel. This is what the Italians
mean by the <em>morbidezza</em> of his flesh-colour. It seems sensitive and
alive all over; not merely to have the look and texture of flesh, but
the feeling in itself. For example, the limbs of his female figures
have a luxurious softness and delicacy, which appears conscious of the
pleasure of the beholder. As the objects themselves in nature would
produce an impression on the sense, distinct from every other object,
and having something divine in it, which the heart owns and the
imagination consecrates, the objects in the picture preserve the same
impression, absolute, unimpaired, stamped with all the truth of passion,
the pride of the eye, and the charm of beauty. Rubens makes his
flesh-colour like flowers; Albano’s is like ivory; Titian’s is like flesh,
and like nothing else. It is as different from that of other painters,
as the skin is from a piece of white or red drapery thrown over it.
The blood circulates here and there, the blue veins just appear, the
rest is distinguished throughout only by that sort of tingling sensation
to the eye, which the body feels within itself. This is gusto.
Vandyke’s flesh-colour, though it has great truth and purity, wants
gusto. It has not the internal character, the living principle in it.
It is a smooth surface, not a warm, moving mass. It is painted without
passion, with indifference. The hand only has been concerned.
The impression slides off from the eye, and does not, like the tones
of Titian’s pencil, leave a sting behind it in the mind of the spectator.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The eye does not acquire a taste or appetite for what it sees. In a
word, gusto in painting is where the impression made on one sense
excites by affinity those of another.</p>

<p class='c000'>Michael Angelo’s forms are full of gusto. They everywhere
obtrude the sense of power upon the eye. His limbs convey an idea
of muscular strength, of moral grandeur, and even of intellectual
dignity: they are firm, commanding, broad, and massy, capable of
executing with ease the determined purposes of the will. His faces
have no other expression than his figures, conscious power and
capacity. They appear only to think what they shall do, and to know
that they can do it. This is what is meant by saying that his style
is hard and masculine. It is the reverse of Correggio’s, which is
effeminate. That is, the gusto of Michael Angelo consists in
expressing energy of will without proportionable sensibility, Correggio’s
in expressing exquisite sensibility without energy of will. In
Correggio’s faces as well as figures we see neither bones nor muscles,
but then what a soul is there, full of sweetness and of grace—pure,
playful, soft, angelical! There is sentiment enough in a hand painted
by Correggio to set up a school of history painters. Whenever we
look at the hands of Correggio’s women or of Raphael’s, we always
wish to touch them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, Titian’s landscapes have a prodigious gusto, both in the
colouring and forms. We shall never forget one that we saw many
years ago in the Orleans Gallery of Acteon hunting. It had a
brown, mellow, autumnal look. The sky was of the colour of stone.
The winds seemed to sing through the rustling branches of the trees,
and already you might hear the twanging of bows resound through
the tangled mazes of the wood. Mr. West, we understand, has this
landscape. He will know if this description of it is just. The landscape
back-ground of the St. Peter Martyr is another well known
instance of the power of this great painter to give a romantic interest
and an appropriate character to the objects of his pencil, where every
circumstance adds to the effect of the scene,—the bold trunks of the
tall forest trees, the trailing ground plants, with that tall convent
spire rising in the distance, amidst the blue sapphire mountains and the
golden sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rubens has a great deal of gusto in his Fauns and Satyrs, and in all
that expresses motion, but in nothing else. Rembrandt has it in
everything; everything in his pictures has a tangible character. If he
puts a diamond in the ear of a burgomaster’s wife, it is of the first
water; and his furs and stuffs are proof against a Russian winter.
Raphael’s gusto was only in expression; he had no idea of the
character of anything but the human form. The dryness and poverty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>of his style in other respects is a phenomenon in the art. His trees
are like sprigs of grass stuck in a book of botanical specimens. Was
it that Raphael never had time to go beyond the walls of Rome?
That he was always in the streets, at church, or in the bath? He was
not one of the Society of Arcadians.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Claude’s landscapes, perfect as they are, want gusto. This is not
easy to explain. They are perfect abstractions of the visible images
of things; they speak the visible language of nature truly. They
resemble a mirror or a microscope. To the eye only they are more
perfect than any other landscapes that ever were or will be painted;
they give more of nature, as cognisable by one sense alone; but they
lay an equal stress on all visible impressions. They do not interpret
one sense by another; they do not distinguish the character of
different objects as we are taught, and can only be taught, to distinguish
them by their effect on the different senses. That is, his eye
wanted imagination: it did not strongly sympathise with his other
faculties. He saw the atmosphere, but he did not feel it. He
painted the trunk of a tree or a rock in the foreground as smooth—with
as complete an abstraction of the gross, tangible impression, as
any other part of the picture. His trees are perfectly beautiful, but
quite immovable; they have a look of enchantment. In short, his
landscapes are unequalled imitations of nature, released from its subjection
to the elements, as if all objects were become a delightful
fairy vision, and the eye had rarefied and refined away the other
senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gusto in the Greek statues is of a very singular kind. The
sense of perfect form nearly occupies the whole mind, and hardly
suffers it to dwell on any other feeling. It seems enough for them
<em>to be</em>, without acting or suffering. Their forms are ideal, spiritual.
Their beauty is power. By their beauty they are raised above the
frailties of pain or passion; by their beauty they are deified.</p>

<p class='c000'>The infinite quantity of dramatic invention in Shakspeare takes
from his gusto. The power he delights to show is not intense, but
discursive. He never insists on anything as much as he might, except
a quibble. Milton has great gusto. He repeats his blows twice;
grapples with and exhausts his subject. His imagination has a double
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>relish of its objects, an inveterate attachment to the things he describes,
and to the words describing them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The power of attaching an interest to the most trifling or painful
pursuits, in which our whole attention and faculties are engaged, is
one of the greatest happinesses of our nature. The common soldier
mounts the breach with joy; the miser deliberately starves himself
to death; the mathematician sets about extracting the cube-root with
a feeling of enthusiasm; and the lawyer sheds tears of admiration
over Coke upon Littleton. It is the same through human life.
He who is not in some measure a pedant, though he may be a wise,
cannot be a very happy man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief charm of reading the old novels is from the picture they
give of the egotism of the characters, the importance of each individual
to himself, and his fancied superiority over every one else. We like,
for instance, the pedantry of Parson Adams, who thought a schoolmaster
the greatest character in the world, and that he was the greatest
schoolmaster in it. We do not see any equivalent for the satisfaction
which this conviction must have afforded him in the most nicely
graduated scale of talents and accomplishments to which he was an
utter stranger. When the old-fashioned Scotch pedagogue turns
Roderick Random round and round, and surveys him from head to
foot with such infinite surprise and laughter, at the same time breaking
out himself into gestures and exclamations still more uncouth and
ridiculous, who would wish to have deprived him of this burst of
extravagant self-complacency? When our follies afford equal delight
to ourselves and those about us, what is there to be desired more?
We cannot discover the vast advantage of ‘seeing ourselves as others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>see us.’ It is better to have a contempt for any one than for
ourselves!</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most constant butts of ridicule, both in the old comedies
and novels, is the professional jargon of the medical tribe. Yet it
cannot be denied that this jargon, however affected it may seem, is
the natural language of apothecaries and physicians, the mother-tongue
of pharmacy! It is that by which their knowledge first comes
to them, that with which they have the most obstinate associations,
that in which they can express themselves the most readily and with
the best effect upon their hearers; and though there may be some
assumption of superiority in all this, yet it is only by an effort of
circumlocution that they could condescend to explain themselves in
ordinary language. Besides, there is a delicacy at bottom; as it is
the only language in which a nauseous medicine can be decorously
administered, or a limb taken off with the proper degree of secrecy.
If the most blundering coxcombs affect this language most, what does
it signify, while they retain the same dignified notions of themselves
and their art, and are equally happy in their knowledge or their
ignorance? The ignorant and pretending physician is a capital
character in Moliere: and, indeed, throughout his whole plays the
great source of the comic interest is in the fantastic exaggeration of
blind self-love, in letting loose the habitual peculiarities of each individual
from all restraint of conscious observation or self-knowledge,
in giving way to that specific levity of impulse which mounts at once
to the height of absurdity, in spite of the obstacles that surround it,
as a fluid in a barometer rises according to the pressure of the external
air! His characters are almost always pedantic, and yet the most
unconscious of all others. Take, for example, those two worthy
gentlemen, Monsieur Jourdain and Monsieur Pourceaugnac.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Learning and pedantry were formerly synonymous; and it was
well when they were so. Can there be a higher satisfaction than
for a man to understand Greek, and to believe that there is nothing
else worth understanding? Learning is the knowledge of that which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>is not generally known. What an ease and a dignity in pretensions,
founded on the ignorance of others! What a pleasure in wondering,
what a pride in being wondered at! In the library of the family
where we were brought up, stood the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fratres Poloni</span></i>; and we can
never forget or describe the feeling with which not only their appearance,
but the names of the authors on the outside inspired us.
Pripscovius, we remember, was one of the easiest to pronounce. The
gravity of the contents seemed in proportion to the weight of the
volumes; the importance of the subjects increased with our ignorance
of them. The trivialness of the remarks, if ever we looked
into them,—the repetitions, the monotony, only gave a greater solemnity
to the whole, as the slowness and minuteness of the evidence
adds to the impressiveness of a judicial proceeding. We knew that
the authors had devoted their whole lives to the production of these
works, carefully abstaining from the introduction of any thing amusing
or lively or interesting. In ten folio volumes there was not one sally
of wit, one striking reflection. What, then, must have been their
sense of the importance of the subject, the profound stores of knowledge
which they had to communicate! ‘From all this world’s
encumbrance they did themselves assoil.’ Such was the notion we
then had of this learned lumber; yet we would rather have this
feeling again for one half-hour than be possessed of all the acuteness
of Bayle or the wit of Voltaire!</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be considered as a sign of the decay of piety and learning
in modern times, that our divines no longer introduce texts of the
original Scriptures into their sermons. The very sound of the
original Greek or Hebrew would impress the hearer with a more
lively faith in the sacred writers than any translation, however literal
or correct. It may be even doubted whether the translation of the
Scriptures into the vulgar tongue was any advantage to the people.
The mystery in which particular points of faith were left involved,
gave an awe and sacredness to religious opinions: the general purport
of the truths and promises of revelation was made known by other
means; and nothing beyond this general and implicit conviction can
be obtained, where all is undefined and infinite.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, it may be questioned whether, in matters of mere human
reasoning, much has been gained by the disuse of the learned languages.
Sir Isaac Newton wrote in Latin; and it is perhaps one of
Bacon’s fopperies that he translated his works into English. If
certain follies have been exposed by being stripped of their formal
disguise, others have had a greater chance of succeeding, by being
presented in a more pleasing and popular shape. This has been
remarkably the case in France, (the least pedantic country in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>world), where the women mingle with everything, even with metaphysics,
and where all philosophy is reduced to a set of phrases for
the toilette. When books are written in the prevailing language of the
country, every one becomes a critic who can read. An author is no
longer tried by his peers. A species of universal suffrage is introduced
in letters, which is only applicable to politics. The good old
Latin style of our forefathers, if it concealed the dullness of the
writer, at least was a barrier against the impertinence, flippancy, and
ignorance of the reader. However, the immediate transition from
the pedantic to the popular style in literature was a change that must
have been very delightful at the time. Our illustrious predecessors,
the <cite>Tatler</cite> and <cite>Spectator</cite>, were very happily off in this respect. They
wore the public favour in its newest gloss, before it had become
tarnished and common—before familiarity had bred contempt. It
was the honey-moon of authorship. Their Essays were among the
first instances in this country of learning sacrificing to the graces, and
of a mutual understanding and good-humoured equality between the
writer and the reader. This new style of composition, to use the
phraseology of Mr. Burke, ‘mitigated authors into companions, and
compelled wisdom to submit to the soft collar of social esteem.’ The
original papers of the <cite>Tatler</cite>, printed on a half sheet of common
foolscap, were regularly served up at breakfast-time with the silver
tea-kettle and thin slices of bread and butter; and what the ingenious
Mr. Bickerstaff wrote overnight in his easy chair, he might flatter
himself would be read the next morning with elegant applause by the
fair, the witty, the learned, and the great, in all parts of this kingdom,
in which civilisation had made any considerable advances. The perfection
of letters is when the highest ambition of the writer is to
please his readers, and the greatest pride of the reader is to understand
his author. The satisfaction on both sides ceases when the
town becomes a club of authors, when each man stands with his
manuscript in his hand waiting for his turn of applause, and when the
claims on our admiration are so many, that, like those of common
beggars, to prevent imposition they can only be answered with general
neglect. Our self-love would be quite bankrupt, if critics by profession
did not come forward as beadles to keep off the crowd, and
to relieve us from the importunity of these innumerable candidates
for fame, by pointing out their faults and passing over their beauties.
In the more auspicious period just alluded to an author was regarded
by the better sort as a man of genius, and by the vulgar, as a kind of
prodigy; insomuch that the Spectator was obliged to shorten his
residence at his friend Sir Roger de Coverley’s, from his being taken
for a conjuror. Every state of society has its advantages and disadvantages.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>An author is at present in no danger of being taken for
a conjuror!</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 23.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>March 10, 1816.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Life is the art of being well deceived; and in order that the deception
may succeed, it must be habitual and uninterrupted. A constant
examination of the value of our opinions and enjoyments, compared
with those of others, may lessen our prejudices, but will leave nothing
for our affections to rest upon. A multiplicity of objects unsettles
the mind, and destroys not only all enthusiasm, but all sincerity of
attachment, all constancy of pursuit; as persons accustomed to an
itinerant mode of life never feel themselves at home in any place. It
is by means of habit that our intellectual employments mix like our
food with the circulation of the blood, and go on like any other part
of the animal functions. To take away the force of habit and prejudice
entirely, is to strike at the root of our personal existence. The
book-worm, buried in the depth of his researches, may well say to
the obtrusive shifting realities of the world, ‘Leave me to my repose!’
We have seen an instance of a poetical enthusiast, who would have
passed his life very comfortably in the contemplation of <em>his own idea</em>,
if he had not been disturbed in his reverie by the Reviewers; and for
our own parts, we think we could pass our lives very learnedly and
classically in one of the quadrangles at Oxford, without any idea at
all, vegetating merely on the air of the place. Chaucer has drawn a
beautiful picture of a true scholar in his Clerk of Oxenford:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A Clerk ther was of Oxenforde also,</div>

      <div class='line'>And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If letters have profited little by throwing down the barrier between
learned prejudice and ignorant presumption, the arts have profited still
less by the universal diffusion of accomplishment and pretension. An
artist is no longer looked upon as any thing, who is not at the same
time ‘chemist, statesman, fiddler, and buffoon.’ It is expected of
him that he should be well-dressed, and he is poor; that he should
move gracefully, and he has never learned to dance; that he should
converse on all subjects, and he understands but one; that he should
be read in different languages, and he only knows his own. Yet
there is one language, the language of Nature, in which it is enough
for him to be able to read, to find everlasting employment and solace
to his thoughts—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Tongues in the trees, books in the running brooks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He will find no end of his labours or of his triumphs there; yet still
feel all his strength not more than equal to the task he has begun—his
whole life too short for art. Rubens complained, that just as he
was beginning to understand his profession, he was forced to quit it.
It was a saying of Michael Angelo, that ‘painting was jealous, and
required the whole man to herself.’ Is it to be supposed that
Rembrandt did not find sufficient resources against the spleen in the
little cell, where mystery and silence hung upon his pencil, or the
noon-tide ray penetrated the solemn gloom around him, without the
aid of modern newspapers, novels, and reviews? Was he not more
wisely employed, while devoted solely to his art—married to that
immortal bride! We do not imagine Sir Joshua Reynolds was
much happier for having written his lectures, nor for the learned
society he kept, friendship apart; and learned society is not necessary
to friendship. He was evidently, as far as conversation was concerned,
little at his ease in it; and he was always glad, as he himself
said, after he had been entertained at the houses of the great, to get
back to his painting-room again. Any one settled pursuit, together
with the ordinary alternations of leisure, exercise, and amusement,
and the natural feelings and relations of society, is quite enough to
take up the whole of our thoughts, time, and affections; and any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>beyond this will, generally speaking, only tend to dissipate and distract
the mind. There is no end of accomplishments, of the prospect
of new acquisitions of taste or skill, or of the uneasiness arising from
the want of them, if we once indulge in this idle habit of vanity and
affectation. The mind is never satisfied with what it is, but is always
looking out for fanciful perfections, which it can neither attain nor
practise. Our failure in any one object is fatal to our enjoyment of
all the rest; and the chances of disappointment multiply with the
number of our pursuits. In catching at the shadow, we lose the
substance. No man can thoroughly master more than one art or
science. The world has never seen a perfect painter. What would
it have availed for Raphael to have aimed at Titian’s colouring, or for
Titian to have imitated Raphael’s drawing, but to have diverted each
from the true bent of his natural genius, and to have made each
sensible of his own deficiencies, without any probability of supplying
them? Pedantry in art, in learning, in every thing, is the setting an
extraordinary value on that which we can do, and that which we
understand best, and which it is our business to do and understand.
Where is the harm of this? To possess or even understand
all kinds of excellence equally, is impossible; and to pretend to
admire that to which we are indifferent, as much as that which is of
the greatest use, and which gives the greatest pleasure to us, is not
liberality, but affectation. Is an artist, for instance, to be required to
feel the same admiration for the works of Handel as for those of
Raphael? If he is sincere, he cannot: and a man, to be free from
pedantry, must be either a coxcomb or a hypocrite. Vestris was so
far in the right, in saying that Voltaire and he were the two greatest
men in Europe. Voltaire was so in the public opinion, and he was
so in his own. Authors and literary people have been unjustly
accused for arrogating an exclusive preference to letters over other arts.
They are justified in doing this, because words are the most natural
and universal language, and because they have the sympathy of the
world with them. Poets, for the same reason, have a right to be the
vainest of authors. The prejudice attached to established reputation
is, in like manner, perfectly well founded, because that which has
longest excited our admiration and the admiration of mankind, is most
entitled to admiration, on the score of habit, sympathy, and deference
to public opinion. There is a sentiment attached to classical reputation,
which cannot belong to new works of genius, till they become
old in their turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>There appears to be a natural division of labour in the ornamental
as well as the mechanical arts of human life. We do not see why a
nobleman should wish to shine as a poet, any more than to be dubbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>a knight, or to be created Lord Mayor of London. If he succeeds,
he gains nothing; and then if he is damned, what a ridiculous figure
he makes! The great, instead of rivalling them, should keep authors,
as they formerly kept fools,—a practice in itself highly laudable, and
the disuse of which might be referred to as the first symptom of the
degeneracy of modern times, and dissolution of the principles of
social order! But of all the instances of a profession now unjustly
obsolete, commend us to the alchemist. We see him sitting fortified
in his prejudices, with his furnace, his diagrams, and his alembics;
smiling at disappointments as proofs of the sublimity of his art, and the
earnest of his future success: wondering at his own knowledge and the
incredulity of others; fed with hope to the last gasp, and having all
the pleasures without the pain of madness. What is there in the discoveries
of modern chemistry equal to the very names of the <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elixir
Vitæ</span></span> and the <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aurum Potabile</span></span>!</p>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Froissard’s Chronicles</cite> there is an account of a reverend Monk
who had been a robber in the early part of his life, and who, when
he grew old, used feelingly to lament that he had ever changed his
profession. He said, ‘It was a goodly sight to sally out from his
castle, and to see a troop of jolly friars coming riding that way, with
their mules well laden with viands and rich stores, to advance towards
them, to attack and overthrow them, returning to the castle with
a noble booty.’ He preferred this mode of life to counting his beads
and chaunting his vespers, and repented that he had ever been prevailed
on to relinquish so laudable a calling. In this confession of remorse,
we may be sure that there was no hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The difference in the character of the gentlemen of the present age
and those of the old school, has been often insisted on. The character
of a gentleman is a <em>relative term</em>, which can hardly subsist where there
is no marked distinction of persons. The diffusion of knowledge, of
artificial and intellectual equality, tends to level this distinction, and
to confound that nice perception and high sense of honour, which
arises from conspicuousness of situation, and a perpetual attention to
personal propriety and the claims of personal respect. The age
of chivalry is gone with the improvements in the art of war, which
superseded the exercise of personal courage; and the character of
a gentleman must disappear with those general refinements in
manners, which render the advantages of rank and situation
accessible almost to every one. The bag-wig and sword naturally
followed the fate of the helmet and the spear, when these outward
insignia no longer implied acknowledged superiority, and were a
distinction without a difference.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spirit of chivalrous and romantic love proceeded on the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>exclusive principle. It was an enthusiastic adoration, an idolatrous
worship paid to sex and beauty. This, even in its blindest excess,
was better than the cold indifference and prostituted gallantry of this
philosophic age. The extreme tendency of civilisation is to dissipate
all intellectual energy, and dissolve all moral principle. We are
sometimes inclined to regret the innovations on the Catholic religion.
It was a noble charter for ignorance, dullness, and prejudice of all
kinds, (perhaps, after all, ‘the sovereign’st things on earth’), and put
an effectual stop to the vanity and restlessness of opinion. ‘It wrapped
the human understanding all round like a blanket.’ Since the
Reformation, altars, unsprinkled by holy oil, are no longer sacred;
and thrones, unsupported by the divine right, have become uneasy and
insecure.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 24.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON THE CHARACTER OF ROUSSEAU&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>April 14, 1816.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Madame de Stael, in her Letters on the Writings and Character
of Rousseau, gives it as her opinion, ‘that the imagination was
the first faculty of his mind, and that this faculty even absorbed
all the others.’<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a> And she farther adds, ‘Rousseau had great strength
of reason on abstract questions, or with respect to objects, which
have no reality but in the mind.’<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Both these opinions are
radically wrong. Neither imagination nor reason can properly be
said to have been the original predominant faculties of his mind.
The strength both of imagination and reason, which he possessed, was
borrowed from the excess of another faculty; and the weakness and
poverty of reason and imagination, which are to be found in his
works, may be traced to the same source, namely, that these faculties
in him were artificial, secondary, and dependant, operating by a power
not theirs, but lent to them. The only quality which he possessed in
an eminent degree, which alone raised him above ordinary men, and
which gave to his writings and opinions an influence greater, perhaps,
than has been exerted by any individual in modern times, was
extreme sensibility, or an acute and even morbid feeling of all that
related to his own impressions, to the objects and events of his life.
He had the most intense consciousness of his own existence. No object
that had once made an impression on him was ever after effaced.
Every feeling in his mind became a passion. His craving after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>excitement was an appetite and a disease. His interest in his own
thoughts and feelings was always wound up to the highest pitch; and
hence the enthusiasm which he excited in others. He owed the
power which he exercised over the opinions of all Europe, by which
he created numberless disciples, and overturned established systems,
to the tyranny which his feelings, in the first instance, exercised over
himself. The dazzling blaze of his reputation was kindled by the
same fire that fed upon his vitals.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a> His ideas differed from those of
other men only in their force and intensity. His genius was the effect
of his temperament. He created nothing, he demonstrated nothing,
by a pure effort of the understanding. His fictitious characters are
modifications of his own being, reflections and shadows of himself.
His speculations are the obvious exaggerations of a mind, giving a
loose to its habitual impulses, and moulding all nature to its own
purposes. Hence his enthusiasm and his eloquence, bearing down
all opposition. Hence the warmth and the luxuriance, as well as the
sameness of his descriptions. Hence the frequent verboseness of his
style; for passion lends force and reality to language, and makes
words supply the place of imagination. Hence the tenaciousness of
his logic, the acuteness of his observations, the refinement and the
inconsistency of his reasoning. Hence his keen penetration, and his
strange want of comprehension of mind: for the same intense feeling
which enabled him to discern the first principles of things, and seize
some one view of a subject in all its ramifications, prevented him from
admitting the operation of other causes which interfered with his
favourite purpose, and involved him in endless wilful contradictions.
Hence his excessive egotism, which filled all objects with himself,
and would have occupied the universe with his smallest interest.
Hence his jealousy and suspicion of others; for no attention, no
respect or sympathy, could come up to the extravagant claims of his
self-love. Hence his dissatisfaction with himself and with all around
him; for nothing could satisfy his ardent longings after good, his restless
appetite of being. Hence his feelings, overstrained and exhausted,
recoiled upon themselves, and produced his love of silence and repose,
his feverish aspirations after the quiet and solitude of nature. Hence
in part also his quarrel with the artificial institutions and distinctions
of society, which opposed so many barriers to the unrestrained
indulgence of his will, and allured his imagination to scenes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>pastoral simplicity or of savage life, where the passions were either not
excited or left to follow their own impulse,—where the petty vexations
and irritating disappointments of common life had no place,—and
where the tormenting pursuits of arts and sciences were lost in pure
animal enjoyment, or indolent repose. Thus he describes the first
savage wandering for ever under the shade of magnificent forests, or
by the side of mighty rivers, smit with the unquenchable love of
nature!</p>

<p class='c000'>The best of all his works is the <cite>Confessions</cite>, though it is that which
has been least read, because it contains the fewest set paradoxes or
general opinions. It relates entirely to himself; and no one was ever
so much at home on this subject as he was. From the strong hold
which they had taken of his mind, he makes us enter into his feelings
as if they had been our own, and we seem to remember every incident
and circumstance of his life as if it had happened to ourselves. We
are never tired of this work, for it everywhere presents us with
pictures which we can fancy to be counterparts of our own existence.
The passages of this sort are innumerable. There is the interesting
account of his childhood, the constraints and thoughtless liberty of
which are so well described; of his sitting up all night reading
romances with his father, till they were forced to desist by hearing
the swallows twittering in their nests; his crossing the Alps, described
with all the feelings belonging to it, his pleasure in setting out, his
satisfaction in coming to his journey’s end, the delight of ‘coming
and going he knew not where’; his arriving at Turin; the figure of
Madame Basile, drawn with such inimitable precision and elegance;
the delightful adventure of the Chateau de Toune, where he passed
the day with Mademoiselle G**** and Mademoiselle Galley; the
story of his Zulietta, the proud, the charming Zulietta, whose last
words, ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Va Zanetto, e studia la Matematica</span></i>,’ were never to be forgotten;
his sleeping near Lyons in a niche of the wall, after a fine
summer’s day, with a nightingale perched above his head; his
first meeting with Madame Warens, the pomp of sound with
which he has celebrated her name, beginning ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louise Eleonore
de Warens étoit<a id='t90'></a> une demoiselle de la Tour de Pil, noble et ancienne

tremble to repeat); his description of her person, her angelic smile,
her mouth of the size of his own; his walking out one day while the
bells were chiming to vespers, and anticipating in a sort of waking
dream the life he afterwards led with her, in which months and years,
and life itself passed away in undisturbed felicity; the sudden disappointment
of his hopes; his transport thirty years after at seeing the
same flower which they had brought home together from one of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>rambles near Chambery; his thoughts in that long interval of time;
his suppers with Grimm and Diderot after he came to Paris; the first
idea of his prize dissertation on the savage state; his account of
writing the <cite>New Eloise</cite>, and his attachment to Madame d’Houdetot;
his literary projects, his fame, his misfortunes, his unhappy temper;
his last solitary retirement in the lake and island of Bienne, with his
dog and his boat; his reveries and delicious musings there; all these
crowd into our minds with recollections which we do not chuse to
express. There are no passages in the <cite>New Eloise</cite> of equal force and
beauty with the best descriptions in the <cite>Confessions</cite>, if we except the
excursion on the water, Julia’s last letter to St. Preux, and his letter
to her, recalling the days of their first loves. We spent two whole
years in reading these two works; and (gentle reader, it was when we
were young) in shedding tears over them</p>

<p class='c000'>They were the happiest years of our life. We may well say of them,
sweet is the dew of their memory, and pleasant the balm of their
recollection! There are, indeed, impressions which neither time nor

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Rousseau, in all his writings, never once lost sight of himself. He
was the same individual from first to last. The spring that moved
his passions never went down, the pulse that agitated his heart never
ceased to beat. It was this strong feeling of interest, accumulating in
his mind, which overpowers and absorbs the feelings of his readers.
He owed all his power to sentiment. The writer who most nearly
resembles him in our own times is the author of the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>.
We see no other difference between them, than that the one wrote in
prose and the other in poetry; and that prose is perhaps better adapted
to express those local and personal feelings, which are inveterate
habits in the mind, than poetry, which embodies its imaginary
creations. We conceive that Rousseau’s exclamation, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, voila de
la pervenche</span></i>,’ comes more home to the mind than Mr. Wordsworth’s
discovery of the linnet’s nest ‘with five blue eggs,’ or than his address
to the cuckoo, beautiful as we think it is; and we will confidently
match the Citizen of Geneva’s adventures on the Lake of Bienne
against the Cumberland Poet’s floating dreams on the Lake of
Grasmere. Both create an interest out of nothing, or rather out of
their own feelings; both weave numberless recollections into one
sentiment; both wind their own being round whatever object occurs
to them. But Rousseau, as a prose-writer, gives only the habitual
and personal impression. Mr. Wordsworth, as a poet, is forced to
lend the colours of imagination to impressions which owe all their
force to their identity with themselves, and tries to paint what is only
to be felt. Rousseau, in a word, interests you in certain objects by
interesting you in himself: Mr. Wordsworth would persuade you that
the most insignificant objects are interesting in themselves, because
he is interested in them. If he had met with Rousseau’s favourite
periwinkle, he would have <em>translated</em> it into the most beautiful of
flowers. This is not imagination, but want of sense. If his jealousy
of the sympathy of others makes him avoid what is beautiful and grand
in nature, why does he undertake elaborately to describe other objects?
<em>His</em> nature is a mere Dulcinea del Toboso, and he would make a
Vashti of her. Rubens appears to have been as extravagantly attached
to his three wives, as Raphael was to his Fornarina; but their faces
were not so classical. The three greatest egotists that we know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of, that is, the three writers who felt their own being most powerfully
and exclusively, are Rousseau, Wordsworth, and Benvenuto
Cellini. As Swift somewhere says, we defy the world to furnish out
a fourth.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a half serious, half ironical argument in Melmoth’s
<cite>Fitz-Osborn’s Letters</cite>, to shew the futility of posthumous fame,
which runs thus: ‘The object of any one who is inspired with this
passion is to be remembered by posterity with admiration and delight,
as having been possessed of certain powers and excellences which
distinguished him above his contemporaries. But posterity, it is said,
can know nothing of the individual but from the memory of these
qualities which he has left behind him. All that we know of Julius
Cæsar, for instance, is that he was the person who performed certain
actions, and wrote a book called his <cite>Commentaries</cite>. When, therefore,
we extol Julius Cæsar for his actions or his writings, what do we say
but that the person who performed certain things did perform them;
that the author of such a work was the person who wrote it; or, in
short, that Julius Cæsar was Julius Cæsar? Now this is a mere
truism, and the desire to be the subject of such an identical proposition
must, therefore, be an evident absurdity.’ The sophism is a
tolerably ingenious one, but it is a sophism, nevertheless. It would
go equally to prove the nullity, not only of posthumous fame, but of
living reputation; for the good or the bad opinion which my next-door
neighbour may entertain of me is nothing more than his conviction
that such and such a person having certain good or bad
qualities is possessed of them; nor is the figure, which a Lord-Mayor
elect, a prating demagogue, or popular preacher, makes in the eyes
of the admiring multitude—<em>himself</em>, but an image of him reflected in
the minds of others, in connection with certain feelings of respect and
wonder. In fact, whether the admiration we seek is to last for a day
or for eternity, whether we are to have it while living or after we are
dead, whether it is to be expressed by our contemporaries or by
future generations, the principle of it is the same—<em>sympathy with the
feelings of others</em>, and the necessary tendency which the idea or consciousness
of the approbation of others has to strengthen the suggestions
of our self-love.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> We are all inclined to think well of ourselves, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>our sense and capacity in whatever we undertake; but from this very
desire to think well of ourselves, we are (as <em>Mrs. Peachum</em> says)
‘<em>bitter</em> bad judges’ of our own pretensions; and when our vanity
flatters us most, we ought in general to suspect it most. We are,
therefore, glad to get the good opinion of a friend, but that may be
partial; the good word of a stranger is likely to be more sincere,
but he may be a blockhead; the multitude will agree with us, if we
agree with them; accident, the caprice of fashion, the prejudice of
the moment, may give a fleeting reputation; our only certain appeal,
therefore, is to posterity; the voice of fame is alone the voice of
truth. In proportion, however, as this award is final and secure, it
is remote and uncertain. Voltaire said to some one, who had
addressed an Epistle to Posterity, ‘I am afraid, my friend, this letter
will never be delivered according to its direction.’ It can exist only
in imagination; and we can only presume upon our claim to it, as we
prefer the hope of lasting fame to every thing else. The love of fame
is almost another name for the love of excellence; or it is the ambition
to attain the highest excellence, sanctioned by the highest
authority, that of time. Vanity, and the love of fame, are quite
distinct from each other; for the one is voracious of the most obvious
and doubtful applause, whereas the other rejects or overlooks every
kind of applause but that which is purified from every mixture of
flattery, and identified with truth and nature itself. There is, therefore,
something disinterested in this passion, inasmuch as it is abstracted
and ideal, and only appeals to opinion as a standard of truth; it is
this which ‘makes ambition virtue.’ Milton had as fine an idea as
any one of true fame; and Dr. Johnson has very beautifully described
his patient and confident anticipations of the success of his great poem
in the account of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. He has, indeed, done the same
thing himself in <em>Lycidas</em>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise</div>
      <div class='line'>(That last infirmity of noble mind)</div>
      <div class='line'>To scorn delights, and live laborious days;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the fair Guerdon when we hope to find,</div>
      <div class='line'>And think to burst out into sudden blaze,</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes the blind Fury with th’ abhorred shears,</div>

      <div class='line'>Phœbus replied, and touch’d my trembling ears.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>None but those who have sterling pretensions can afford to refer
them to time; as persons who live upon their means cannot well go
into Chancery. No feeling can be more at variance with the true
love of fame than that impatience which we have sometimes witnessed
to ‘pluck its fruits, unripe and crude,’ before the time, to make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>little echo of popularity mimic the voice of fame, and to convert a
prize-medal or a newspaper-puff into a passport to immortality.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we hear any one complaining that he has not the same fame
as some poet or painter who lived two hundred years ago, he seems
to us to complain that he has not been dead these two hundred years.
When his fame has undergone the same ordeal, that is, has lasted as
long, it will be as good, if he really deserves it. We think it equally
absurd, when we sometimes find people objecting, that such an acquaintance
of theirs, who has not an idea in his head, should be so
much better off in the world than they are. But it is for this very
reason; they have preferred the indulgence of their ideas to the
pursuit of realities. It is but fair that he who has no ideas should
have something in their stead. If he who has devoted his time to
the study of beauty, to the pursuit of truth, whose object has been
to govern opinion, to form the taste of others, to instruct or to amuse
the public, succeeds in this respect, he has no more right to complain
that he has not a title or a fortune, than he who has not purchased
a ticket, that is, who has taken no means to the end, has a right to
complain that he has not a prize in the lottery.</p>

<p class='c000'>In proportion as men can command the immediate and vulgar
applause of others, they become indifferent to that which is remote
and difficult of attainment. We take pains only when we are compelled
to do it. Little men are remarked to have courage; little
women to have wit; and it is seldom that a man of genius is a
coxcomb in his dress. Rich men are contented not to be thought
wise; and the Great often think themselves well off, if they can escape
being the jest of their acquaintance. Authors were actuated by the
desire of the applause of posterity, only so long as they were debarred
of that of their contemporaries, just as we see the map of the gold-mines
of Peru hanging in the room of Hogarth’s <cite>Distressed Poet</cite>.
In the midst of the ignorance and prejudices with which they were
surrounded, they had a sort of <em>forlorn hope</em> in the prospect of immortality.
The spirit of universal criticism has superseded the anticipation
of posthumous fame, and instead of waiting for the award of distant
ages, the poet or prose-writer receives his final doom from the next
number of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> or <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>. According as the
nearness of the applause increases, our impatience increases with it.
A writer in a weekly journal engages with reluctance in a monthly
publication: and again, a contributor to a daily paper sets about his
task with greater spirit than either of them. It is like prompt
payment. The effort and the applause go together. We, indeed,
have known a man of genius and eloquence, to whom, from a habit
of excessive talking, the certainty of seeing what he wrote in print
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the next day was too remote a stimulus for his imagination, and who
constantly laid aside his pen in the middle of an article, if a friend
dropped in, to finish the subject more effectually aloud, so that the
approbation of his hearer, and the sound of his own voice might be
co-instantaneous. Members of Parliament seldom turn authors, except
to print their speeches when they have not been distinctly heard or
understood; and great orators are generally very indifferent writers,
from want of sufficient inducement to exert themselves, when the
immediate effect on others is not perceived, and the irritation of
applause or opposition ceases.</p>

<p class='c000'>There have been in the last century two singular examples of
literary reputation, the one of an author without a name, and the
other of a name without an author. We mean the author of <cite>Junius’s
Letters</cite>, and the translator of the mottos to the <cite>Rambler</cite>, whose name
was Elphinstone. The <cite>Rambler</cite> was published in the year 1750, and
the name of Elphinstone prefixed to each paper is familiar to every
literary reader, since that time, though we know nothing more of him.
We saw this gentleman, since the commencement of the present
century, looking over a clipped hedge in the country, with a broad-flapped
hat, a venerable countenance, and his dress cut out with the
same formality as his ever-greens. His name had not only survived
half a century in conjunction with that of Johnson, but he had
survived with it, enjoying all the dignity of a classical reputation, and
the ease of a literary sinecure, on the strength of his mottos. The
author of <cite>Junius’s Letters</cite> is, on the contrary, as remarkable an
instance of a writer who has arrived at all the public honours of
literature, without being known by name to a single individual, and
who may be said to have realised all the pleasure of posthumous fame,
while living, without the smallest gratification of personal vanity.
An anonymous writer may feel an acute interest in what is said of
his productions, and a secret satisfaction in their success, because it is
not the effect of personal considerations, as the overhearing any one
speak well of us is more agreeable than a direct compliment. But
this very satisfaction will tempt him to communicate his secret. This
temptation, however, does not extend beyond the circle of his
acquaintance. With respect to the public, who know an author only
by his writings, it is of little consequence whether he has a real or
a fictitious name, or a signature, so that they have some clue by which
to associate the works with the author. In the case of <em>Junius</em>, therefore,
where other personal considerations of interest or connections
might immediately counteract and set aside this temptation, the
triumph over the mere vanity of authorship might not have cost him
so dear as we are at first inclined to imagine. Suppose it to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>been the old Marquis of ——? It is quite out of the question that
he should keep his places and not keep his secret. If ever the King
should die, we think it not impossible that the secret may out.
Certainly the <em>accouchement</em> of any princess in Europe would not
excite an equal interest. ‘And you, then, Sir, are the author of
<em>Junius</em>!’ What a recognition for the public and the author! That
between Yorick and the Frenchman was a trifle to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have said that we think the desire to be known by name as
an author chiefly has a reference to those to whom we are known
personally, and is strongest with regard to those who know most of
our persons and least of our capacities. We wish to <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">subpœna</span></em> the
public to our characters. Those who, by great services or great
meannesses, have attained titles, always take them from the place with
which they have the earliest associations, and thus strive to throw a
veil of importance over the insignificance of their original pretensions,
or the injustice of fortune. When Lord Nelson was passing over the
quay at Yarmouth, to take possession of the ship to which he had
been appointed, the people exclaimed, ‘Why make that little fellow
a captain?’ He thought of this when he fought the battles of the
Nile and Trafalgar. The same sense of personal insignificance which
made him great in action made him a fool in love. If Bonaparte had
been six inches higher, he never would have gone on that disastrous
Russian expedition, nor ‘with that addition’ would he ever have been
Emperor and King. For our own parts, one object which we have in
writing these Essays, is to send them in a volume to a person who took
some notice of us when children, and who augured, perhaps, better of
us than we deserved. In fact, the opinion of those who know us
most, who are a kind of second self in our recollections, is a sort of
second conscience; and the approbation of one or two friends is all
the immortality <em>we</em> pretend to.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a late number of a respectable publication, there is the following
description of the French character:—</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Extremes meet. This is the only way of accounting for that
enigma, the French character. It has often been remarked, that this
ingenious nation exhibits more striking contradictions than any other
that ever existed. They are the gayest of the gay, and the gravest
of the grave. Their very faces pass at once from an expression of
the most lively animation, when they are in conversation or in action,
to a melancholy blank. They are the lightest and most volatile, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>at the same time the most plodding, mechanical, and laborious people
in Europe. They are one moment the slaves of the most contemptible
prejudices, and the next launch out into all the extravagance of the
most abstract speculations. In matters of taste they are as inexorable
as they are lax in questions of morality; they judge of the one by
rules, of the other by their inclinations. It seems at times as if
nothing could shock them, and yet they are offended at the merest
trifles. The smallest things make the greatest impression on them.
From the facility with which they can accommodate themselves to
circumstances, they have no fixed principles or real character. They
are always that which gives them least pain, or costs them least
trouble. They easily disentangle their thoughts from whatever causes
the slightest uneasiness, and direct their sensibility to flow in any
channels they think proper. Their whole existence is more theatrical
than real—their sentiments put on or off like the dress of an actor.
Words are with them equivalent to things. They say what is agreeable,
and believe what they say. Virtue and vice, good and evil,
liberty and slavery, are matters almost of indifference. Their natural
self-complacency stands them in stead of all other advantages.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing account is pretty near the truth; we have nothing
to say against it; but we shall here endeavour to do a like piece of
justice to our countrymen, who are too apt to mistake the vices of
others for so many virtues in themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a Frenchman is pleased with every thing, John Bull is pleased
with nothing, and that is a fault. He is, to be sure, fond of having
his own way, till you let him have it. He is a very headstrong
animal, who mistakes the spirit of contradiction for the love of independence,
and proves himself to be in the right by the obstinacy
with which he stickles for the wrong. You cannot put him so much
out of his way as by agreeing with him. He is never in such good-humour
as with what gives him the spleen, and is most satisfied when
he is sulky. If you find fault with him, he is in a rage; and if you
praise him, suspects you have a design upon him. He recommends
himself to another by affronting him, and if that will not do, knocks
him down to convince him of his sincerity. He gives himself such
airs as no mortal ever did, and wonders at the rest of the world for
not thinking him the most amiable person breathing. John means
well too, but he has an odd way of showing it, by a total disregard
of other people’s feelings and opinions. He is sincere, for he tells
you at the first word he does not like you; and never deceives, for
he never offers to serve you. A civil answer is too much to expect
from him. A word costs him more than a blow. He is silent
because he has nothing to say, and he looks stupid because he is so.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>He has the strangest notions of beauty. The expression he values
most in the human countenance is an appearance of roast beef and
plum-pudding; and if he has a red face and round belly, thinks himself
a great man. He is a little purse-proud, and has a better opinion
of himself for having made a full meal. But his greatest delight is
in a bugbear. This he must have, be the consequence what it may.
Whoever will give him that, may lead him by the nose, and pick his
pocket at the same time. An idiot in a country town, a Presbyterian
parson, a dog with a cannister tied to his tail, a bull-bait, or a fox-hunt,
are irresistible attractions to him. The Pope was formerly his great
aversion, and latterly, a cap of liberty is a thing he cannot abide. He
discarded the Pope, and defied the Inquisition, called the French a
nation of slaves and beggars, and abused their <em>Grand Monarque</em> for
a tyrant, cut off one king’s head, and exiled another, set up a Dutch
Stadtholder, and elected a Hanoverian Elector to be king over him,
to shew he would have his own way, and to teach the rest of the
world what they should do: but since other people took to imitating
his example, John has taken it into his head to hinder them, will
have a monopoly of rebellion and regicide to himself, has become
sworn brother to the Pope, and stands by the Inquisition, restores
his old enemies, the Bourbons, and reads <em>a great moral lesson</em> to their
subjects, persuades himself that the Dutch Stadtholder and the
Hanoverian Elector came to reign over him by divine right, and does
all he can to prove himself a beast to make other people slaves. The
truth is, John was always a surly, meddlesome, obstinate fellow, and
of late years his <em>head</em> has not been quite right! In short, John is a
great blockhead and a great bully, and requires (what he has been
long labouring for) a hundred years of slavery to bring him to his
senses. He will have it that he is a great patriot, for he hates all
other countries; that he is wise, for he thinks all other people fools;
that he is honest, for he calls all other people whores and rogues. If
being in an ill-humour all one’s life is the perfection of human nature,
then John is very near it. He beats his wife, quarrels with his
neighbours, damns his servants, and gets drunk to kill the time and
keep up his spirits, and firmly believes himself the only unexceptionable,
accomplished, moral, and religious character in Christendom.
He boasts of the excellence of the laws, and the goodness of his own
disposition; and yet there are more people hanged in England than
in all Europe besides: he boasts of the modesty of his countrywomen,
and yet there are more prostitutes in the streets of London
than in all the capitals of Europe put together. He piques himself
on his comforts, because he is the most uncomfortable of mortals;
and because he has no enjoyment in society, seeks it, as he says, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>his fireside, where he may be stupid as a matter of course, sullen as
a matter of right, and as ridiculous as he chuses without being
laughed at. His liberty is the effect of his self-will; his religion
owing to the spleen; his temper to the climate. He is an industrious
animal, because he has no taste for amusement, and had rather work
six days in the week than be idle one. His awkward attempts at
gaiety are the jest of other nations. ‘They,’ (the English), says
Froissard, speaking of the meeting of the Black Prince and the
French King, ‘amused themselves sadly, according to the custom of
their country,’—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">se rejouissoient tristement, selon la coutume de leur
pays</span></i>. Their patience of labour is confined to what is repugnant
and disagreeable in itself, to the drudgery of the mechanic arts,
and does not extend to the fine arts; that is, they are indifferent
to pain, but insensible to pleasure. They will stand in a trench, or
march up to a breach, but they cannot bear to dwell long on an
agreeable object. They can no more submit to regularity in art than
to decency in behaviour. Their pictures are as coarse and slovenly
as their address. John boasts of his great men, without much right
to do so; not that he has not had them, but because he neither
knows nor cares anything about them but to swagger over other
nations. That which chiefly hits John’s fancy in Shakspeare is
that he was a deer-stealer in his youth; and, as for Newton’s discoveries,
he hardly knows to this day that the earth is round. John’s
oaths, which are quite characteristic, have got him the nickname
of <em>Monsieur God-damn-me</em>. They are profane, a Frenchman’s indecent.
One swears by his vices, the other by their punishment.
After all John’s blustering, he is but a dolt. His habitual jealousy
of others makes him the inevitable dupe of quacks and impostors of
all sorts; he goes all lengths with one party out of spite to another;
his zeal is as furious as his antipathies are unfounded; and there is
nothing half so absurd or ignorant of its own intentions as an English
mob.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Shaftesbury somewhere remarks, that a great many people
pass for very good-natured persons, for no other reason than because
they care about nobody but themselves; and, consequently, as nothing
annoys them but what touches their own interest, they never irritate
themselves unnecessarily about what does not concern them, and
seem to be made of the very milk of human kindness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Good-nature, or what is often considered as such, is the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>selfish of all the virtues: it is nine times out of ten mere indolence
of disposition. A good-natured man is, generally speaking, one who
does not like to be put out of his way; and as long as he can help
it, that is, till the provocation comes home to himself, he will not.
He does not create fictitious uneasiness out of the distresses of others;
he does not fret and fume, and make himself uncomfortable about
things he cannot mend, and that no way concern him, even if he
could: but then there is no one who is more apt to be disconcerted
by what puts him to any personal inconvenience, however trifling;
who is more tenacious of his selfish indulgences, however unreasonable;
or who resents more violently any interruption of his ease and
comforts, the very trouble he is put to in resenting it being felt as
an aggravation of the injury. A person of this character feels no
emotions of anger or detestation, if you tell him of the devastation
of a province, or the massacre of the inhabitants of a town, or the
enslaving of a people; but if his dinner is spoiled by a lump of soot
falling down the chimney, he is thrown into the utmost confusion,
and can hardly recover a decent command of his temper for the whole
day. He thinks nothing can go amiss, so long as he is at his ease,
though a pain in his little finger makes him so peevish and quarrelsome,
that nobody can come near him. Knavery and injustice in
the abstract are things that by no means ruffle his temper, or alter
the serenity of his countenance, unless he is to be the sufferer by
them; nor is he ever betrayed into a passion in answering a sophism,
if he does not think it immediately directed against his own interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the contrary, we sometimes meet with persons who regularly
heat themselves in an argument, and get out of humour on every
occasion, and make themselves obnoxious to a whole company about
nothing. This is not because they are ill-tempered, but because they
are in earnest. Good-nature is a hypocrite: it tries to pass off its
love of its own ease and indifference to everything else for a particular
softness and mildness of disposition. All people get in a passion, and
lose their temper, if you offer to strike them, or cheat them of their
money, that is, if you interfere with that which they are really
interested in. Tread on the heel of one of these good-natured persons,
who do not care if the whole world is in flames, and see how he
will bear it. If the truth were known, the most disagreeable people
are the most amiable. They are the only persons who feel an interest
in what does not concern them. They have as much regard for
others as they have for themselves. They have as many vexations
and causes of complaint as there are in the world. They are general
righters of wrongs, and redressers of grievances. They not only are
annoyed by what they can help, by an act of inhumanity done in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>next street, or in a neighbouring country by their own countrymen,
they not only do not claim any share in the glory, and hate it the
more, the more brilliant the success,—but a piece of injustice done
three thousand years ago touches them to the quick. They have an
unfortunate attachment to a set of abstract phrases, such as <em>liberty</em>,
<em>truth</em>, <em>justice</em>, <em>humanity</em>, <em>honour</em>, which are continually abused by knaves,
and misunderstood by fools, and they can hardly contain themselves
for spleen. They have something to keep them in perpetual hot
water. No sooner is one question set at rest than another rises up
to perplex them. They wear themselves to the bone in the affairs
of other people, to whom they can do no manner of service, to the
neglect of their own business and pleasure. They tease themselves
to death about the morality of the Turks, or the politics of the French.
There are certain words that afflict their ears, and things that lacerate
their souls, and remain a plague-spot there forever after. They have
a fellow-feeling with all that has been done, said, or thought in the
world. They have an interest in all science and in all art. They
hate a lie as much as a wrong, for truth is the foundation of all justice.
Truth is the first thing in their thoughts, then mankind, then their
country, last themselves. They love excellence, and bow to fame,
which is the shadow of it. Above all, they are anxious to see justice
done to the dead, as the best encouragement to the living, and the
lasting inheritance of future generations. They do not like to see
a great principle undermined, or the fall of a great man. They would
sooner forgive a blow in the face than a wanton attack on acknowledged
reputation. The contempt in which the French hold Shakspeare
is a serious evil to them; nor do they think the matter mended,
when they hear an Englishman, who would be thought a profound
one, say that Voltaire was a man without wit. They are vexed to
see genius playing at Tom Fool, and honesty turned bawd. It gives
them a cutting sensation to see a number of things which, as they are
unpleasant to see, we shall not here repeat. In short, they have a
passion for truth; they feel the same attachment to the idea of what
is right, that a knave does to his interest, or that a good-natured man
does to his ease; and they have as many sources of uneasiness as
there are actual or supposed deviations from this standard in the sum
of things, or as there is a possibility of folly and mischief in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>Principle is a passion for truth; an incorrigible attachment to a
general proposition. Good-nature is humanity that costs nothing.
No good-natured man was ever a martyr to a cause, in religion or
politics. He has no idea of striving against the stream. He may
become a good courtier and a loyal subject; and it is hard if he does
not, for he has nothing to do in that case but to consult his ease,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>interest, and outward appearances. The Vicar of Bray was a good-natured
man. What a pity he was but a vicar! A good-natured
man is utterly unfit for any situation or office in life that requires
integrity, fortitude, or generosity,—any sacrifice, except of opinion,
or any exertion, but to please. A good-natured man will debauch
his friend’s mistress, if he has an opportunity; and betray his friend,
sooner than share disgrace or danger with him. He will not forego
the smallest gratification to save the whole world. He makes his
own convenience the standard of right and wrong. He avoids the
feeling of pain in himself, and shuts his eyes to the sufferings of others.
He will put a malefactor or an innocent person (no matter which) to
the rack, and only laugh at the uncouthness of the gestures, or wonder
that he is so unmannerly as to cry out. There is no villainy to which
he will not lend a helping hand with great coolness and cordiality,
for he sees only the pleasant and profitable side of things. He will
assent to a falsehood with a leer of complacency, and applaud any
atrocity that comes recommended in the garb of authority. He will
betray his country to please a Minister, and sign the death-warrant
of thousands of wretches, rather than forfeit the congenial smile, the
well-known squeeze of the hand. The shrieks of death, the torture
of mangled limbs, the last groans of despair, are things that shock his
smooth humanity too much ever to make an impression on it: his
good-nature sympathizes only with the smile, the bow, the gracious
salutation, the fawning answer: vice loses its sting, and corruption
its poison, in the oily gentleness of his disposition. He will not hear
of any thing wrong in Church or State. He will defend every abuse
by which any thing is to be got, every dirty job, every act of every
Minister. In an extreme case, a very good-natured man indeed may
try to hang twelve honester men than himself to rise at the Bar, and
forge the seal of the realm to continue his colleagues a week longer
in office. He is a slave to the will of others, a coward to their
prejudices, a tool of their vices. A good-natured man is no more
fit to be trusted in public affairs, than a coward or a woman is to lead
an army. Spleen is the soul of patriotism and of public good. Lord
Castlereagh is a good-natured man, Lord Eldon is a good-natured
man, Charles Fox was a good-natured man. The last instance is
the most decisive. The definition of a true patriot is <em>a good hater</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A king, who is a good-natured man, is in a fair way of being a great
tyrant. A king ought to feel concern for all to whom his power
extends; but a good-natured man cares only about himself. If he
has a good appetite, eats and sleeps well, nothing in the universe
besides can disturb him. The destruction of the lives or liberties
of his subjects will not stop him in the least of his caprices, but will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>concoct well with his bile, and ‘good digestion wait on appetite, and
health on both.’ He will send out his mandate to kill and destroy
with the same indifference or satisfaction that he performs any natural
function of his body. The consequences are placed beyond the reach
of his imagination, or would not affect him if they were not, for he
is a fool, and good-natured. A good-natured man hates more than
any one else whatever thwarts his will, or contradicts his prejudices;
and if he has the power to prevent it, depend upon it, he will use it
without remorse and without control.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a lower species of this character which is what is usually
understood by a <em>well-meaning man</em>. A well-meaning man is one who
often does a great deal of mischief without any kind of malice. He
means no one any harm, if it is not for his interest. He is not a
knave, nor perfectly honest. He does not easily resign a good place.
Mr. Vansittart is a well-meaning man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irish are a good-natured people; they have many virtues,
but their virtues are those of the heart, not of the head. In their
passions and affections they are sincere, but they are hypocrites in
understanding. If they once begin to calculate the consequences,
self-interest prevails. An Irishman who trusts to his principles, and
a Scotchman who yields to his impulses, are equally dangerous. The
Irish have wit, genius, eloquence, imagination, affections: but they
want coherence of understanding, and consequently have no standard
of thought or action. Their strength of mind does not keep pace
with the warmth of their feelings, or the quickness of their conceptions.
Their animal spirits run away with them: their reason is a
jade. There is something crude, indigested, rash, and discordant, in
almost all that they do or say. They have no system, no abstract
ideas. They are ‘everything by starts, and nothing long.’ They
are a wild people. They hate whatever imposes a law on their
understandings, or a yoke on their wills. To betray the principles
they are most bound by their own professions and the expectations
of others to maintain, is with them a reclamation of their original
rights, and to fly in the face of their benefactors and friends, an
assertion of their natural freedom of will. They want consistency
and good faith. They unite fierceness with levity. In the midst
of their headlong impulses, they have an under-current of selfishness
and cunning, which in the end gets the better of them. Their
feelings, when no longer excited by novelty or opposition, grow cold
and stagnant. Their blood, if not heated by passion, turns to poison.
They have a rancour in their hatred of any object they have abandoned,
proportioned to the attachment they have professed to it. Their zeal,
converted against itself, is furious. The late Mr. Burke was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>instance of an Irish patriot and philosopher. He abused metaphysics,
because he could make nothing out of them, and turned his back upon
liberty, when he found he could get nothing more by her.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a>—See to

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 28.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON THE CHARACTER OF MILTON’S EVE&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>July 21, 1816.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The difference between the character of <em>Eve</em> in Milton and Shakspeare’s
female characters is very striking, and it appears to us to be
this: Milton describes <em>Eve</em> not only as full of love and tenderness
for <em>Adam</em>, but as the constant object of admiration in herself. She
is the idol of the poet’s imagination, and he paints her whole person
with a studied profusion of charms. She is the wife, but she is still
as much as ever the mistress, of <em>Adam</em>. She is represented, indeed,
as devoted to her husband, as twining round him for support ‘as the
vine curls her tendrils,’ but her own grace and beauty are never lost
sight of in the picture of conjugal felicity. <em>Adam’s</em> attention and
regard are as much turned to her as hers to him; for ‘in that first
garden of their innocence,’ he had no other objects or pursuits to
distract his attention; she was both his business and his pleasure.
Shakspeare’s females, on the contrary, seem to exist only in their
attachment to others. They are pure abstractions of the affections.
Their features are not painted, nor the colour of their hair. Their
hearts only are laid open. We are acquainted with <em>Imogen</em>, <em>Miranda</em>,
<em>Ophelia</em>, or <em>Desdemona</em>, by what they thought and felt, but we
cannot tell whether they were black, brown, or fair. But Milton’s
<cite>Eve</cite> is all of ivory and gold. Shakspeare seldom tantalises the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>reader with a luxurious display of the personal charms of his heroines,
with a curious inventory of particular beauties, except indirectly, and
for some other purpose, as where <em>Jachimo</em> describes <em>Imogen</em> asleep,
or the old men in the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite> vie with each other in invidious
praise of <em>Perdita</em>. Even in <em>Juliet</em>, the most voluptuous and glowing
of the class of characters here spoken of, we are reminded chiefly
of circumstances connected with the physiognomy of passion, as in
her leaning with her cheek upon her arm, or which only convey the
general impression of enthusiasm made on her lover’s brain. One
thing may be said, that Shakspeare had not the same opportunities
as Milton: for his women were clothed, and it cannot be denied that
Milton took <em>Eve</em> at a considerable disadvantage in this respect. He
has accordingly described her in all the loveliness of nature, tempting
to sight as the fruit of the Hesperides guarded by that Dragon old,
herself the fairest among the flowers of Paradise!</p>

<p class='c000'>The figures both of <em>Adam</em> and <em>Eve</em> are very prominent in this
poem. As there is little action in it, the interest is constantly kept
up by the beauty and grandeur of the images. They are thus introduced:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Godlike erect, with native honour clad,</div>
      <div class='line'>In naked majesty seemed lords of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine</div>
      <div class='line'>The image of their glorious Maker shone:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>——Though both</div>
      <div class='line'>Not equal, as their sex not equal seem’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>For contemplation he and valour form’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>For softness she and sweet attractive grace;</div>
      <div class='line'>He for God only, she for God in him.</div>
      <div class='line'>His fair large front and eye sublime declar’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks</div>
      <div class='line'>Round from his parted forelock manly hung</div>
      <div class='line'>Clust’ring, but not beneath his shoulders broad;</div>
      <div class='line'>She as a veil down to the slender waist</div>
      <div class='line'>Her unadorned golden tresses wore</div>
      <div class='line'>Dishevell’d, but in wanton ringlets wav’d</div>
      <div class='line'>As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied</div>
      <div class='line'>Subjection, but required with gentle sway,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by her yielded, by him best receiv’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sweet reluctant amorous delay.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Eve</em> is not only represented as beautiful, but with conscious beauty.
Shakspeare’s heroines are almost insensible of their charms, and
wound without knowing it. They are not coquets. If the salvation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of mankind had depended upon one of them, we don’t know—but the
Devil might have been baulked. This is but a conjecture! <em>Eve</em> has
a great idea of herself, and there is some difficulty in prevailing on her
to quit her own image, the first time she discovers its reflection in
the water. She gives the following account of herself to <em>Adam</em>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That day I oft remember, when from sleep</div>
      <div class='line'>I first awak’d, and found myself repos’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Under a shade on flow’rs, much wond’ring where</div>
      <div class='line'>And what I was, whence thither brought and how.</div>
      <div class='line'>Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound</div>
      <div class='line'>Of waters issued from a cave, and spread</div>
      <div class='line'>Into a liquid plain, then stood unmov’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Pure as the expanse of Heav’n; I thither went</div>
      <div class='line'>With unexperienc’d thought, and laid me down</div>
      <div class='line'>On the green bank, to look into the clear</div>
      <div class='line'>Smooth lake, that to me seem’d another sky.</div>
      <div class='line'>As I bent down to look, just opposite</div>
      <div class='line'>A shape within the watery gleam appear’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bending to look on me; I started back,</div>
      <div class='line'>It started back; but pleas’d I soon return’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleas’d it return’d as soon with answ’ring looks</div>
      <div class='line'>Of sympathy and love.’...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The poet afterwards adds:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘So spake our general mother, and with eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of conjugal attraction unreprov’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And meek surrender, half-embracing lean’d</div>
      <div class='line'>On our first father; half her swelling breast</div>
      <div class='line'>Naked met his under the flowing gold</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight</div>
      <div class='line'>Both of her beauty and submissive charms;</div>
      <div class='line'>Smil’d with superior love, as Jupiter</div>
      <div class='line'>On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds</div>
      <div class='line'>That shed May flowers.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The same thought is repeated with greater simplicity, and perhaps
even beauty, in the beginning of the Fifth Book:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>——‘So much the more</div>
      <div class='line'>His wonder was to find unawaken’d Eve</div>
      <div class='line'>With tresses discompos’d and glowing cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>As through unquiet rest: he on his side</div>
      <div class='line'>Leaning half-rais’d, with looks of cordial love</div>
      <div class='line'>Hung over her enamour’d, and beheld</div>
      <div class='line'>Beauty, which whether waking or asleep</div>
      <div class='line'>Shot forth peculiar graces; then, with voice</div>
      <div class='line'>Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Her hand soft touching, whisper’d thus. Awake</div>
      <div class='line'>My fairest, my espous’d, my latest found,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heav’n’s last best gift, my ever new delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Awake’....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The general style, indeed, in which <em>Eve</em> is addressed by <em>Adam</em>,
or described by the poet, is in the highest strain of compliment:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘When Adam thus to Eve. Fair consort, the hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Of night approaches.’...</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorn’d.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To whom our general ancestor replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Daughter of God and Man, accomplish’d Eve.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Eve</em> is herself so well convinced that these epithets are her due, that
the idea follows her in her sleep, and she dreams of herself as the
paragon of nature, the wonder of the universe:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>——‘Methought</div>
      <div class='line'>Close at mine ear one call’d me forth to walk,</div>
      <div class='line'>With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,</div>
      <div class='line'>Why sleep’st thou, Eve? Now is the pleasant time,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cool, the silent, save where silence yields</div>
      <div class='line'>To the night-warbling bird, that now awake</div>
      <div class='line'>Tunes sweetest his love-labour’d song; now reigns</div>
      <div class='line'>Full-orb’d the moon, and with more pleasing light</div>
      <div class='line'>Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>If none regard; Heav’n wakes with all his eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom to behold but thee, Nature’s desire?</div>
      <div class='line'>In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment</div>
      <div class='line'>Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This is the very topic, too, on which the Serpent afterwards
enlarges with so much artful insinuation and fatal confidence of
success. ‘So talked the spirited sly snake.’ The conclusion of the
foregoing scene, in which <em>Eve</em> relates her dream and <em>Adam</em> comforts
her, is such an exquisite piece of description, that, though not to our
immediate purpose, we cannot refrain from quoting it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘So cheer’d he his fair spouse, and she was cheer’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>But silently a gentle tear let fall</div>
      <div class='line'>From either eye, and wip’d them with her hair;</div>
      <div class='line'>Two other precious drops that ready stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell</div>
      <div class='line'>Kiss’d, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse</div>
      <div class='line'>And pious awe, that fear’d to have offended.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>The formal eulogy on <em>Eve</em> which <em>Adam</em> addresses to the Angel,
in giving an account of his own creation and hers, is full of elaborate
grace:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Under his forming hands a creature grew,</div>
      <div class='line'>.&#8196; &#8196; .&#8196; &#8196; .&#8196; &#8196; .&#8196; &#8196; .&#8196; &#8196; so lovely fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>That what seem’d fair in all the world, seem’d now</div>
      <div class='line'>Mean, or in her summ’d up, in her contained</div>
      <div class='line'>And in her looks, which from that time infus’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,</div>
      <div class='line'>And into all things from her air inspir’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The spirit of love and amorous delight.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>That which distinguishes Milton from the other poets, who have
pampered the eye and fed the imagination with exuberant descriptions
of female beauty, is the moral severity with which he has tempered
them. There is not a line in his works which tends to licentiousness,
or the impression of which, if it has such a tendency, is not
effectually checked by thought and sentiment. The following are
two remarkable instances:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>——‘In shadier bower</div>
      <div class='line'>More secret and sequester’d, though but feign’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recess,</div>
      <div class='line'>With flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Espoused Eve deck’d first her nuptial bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heavenly quires the hymenœan sung,</div>
      <div class='line'>What day the genial Angel to our sire</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought her in naked beauty more adorn’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>More lovely than Pandora, whom the Gods</div>
      <div class='line'>Endow’d with all their gifts, and O too like</div>
      <div class='line'>In sad event, when to th’ unwiser son</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Mankind by her fair looks, to be aveng’d</div>
      <div class='line'>On him who had stole Jove’s authentic fire.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The other is a passage of extreme beauty and pathos blended. It
is the one in which the Angel is described as the guest of our first
ancestors:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>——‘Meanwhile at table Eve</div>
      <div class='line'>Minister’d naked, and their flowing cups</div>
      <div class='line'>With pleasant liquors crown’d: O innocence</div>
      <div class='line'>Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then had the sons of God excuse to have been</div>
      <div class='line'>Enamour’d at that sight; but in those hearts</div>
      <div class='line'>Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy</div>
      <div class='line'>Was understood, the injur’d lover’s Hell.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The character which a living poet has given of Spenser, would be
much more true of Milton:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——‘Yet not more sweet</div>
      <div class='line'>Than pure was he, and not more pure than wise;</div>
      <div class='line'>High Priest of all the Muses’ mysteries.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Spenser, on the contrary, is very apt to pry into mysteries which
do not belong to the Muses. Milton’s voluptuousness is not lascivious
or sensual. He describes beautiful objects for their own sakes.
Spenser has an eye to the consequences, and steeps everything in
pleasure, often not of the purest kind. The want of passion has been
brought as an objection against Milton, and his <cite>Adam</cite> and <em>Eve</em> have
been considered as rather insipid personages, wrapped up in one
another, and who excite but little sympathy in any one else. We do
not feel this objection ourselves: we are content to be spectators in
such scenes, without any other excitement. In general, the interest in
Milton is essentially epic, and not dramatic; and the difference
between the epic and the dramatic is this, that in the former the
imagination produces the passion, and in the latter the passion produces
the imagination. The interest of epic poetry arises from the
contemplation of certain objects in themselves grand and beautiful: the
interest of dramatic poetry from sympathy with the passions and
pursuits of others; that is, from the practical relations of certain
persons to certain objects, as depending on accident or will.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pyramids of Egypt are epic objects; the imagination of them
is necessarily attended with passion; but they have no dramatic
interest, till circumstances connect them with some human catastrophe.
Now, a poem might be constructed almost entirely of such images, of
the highest intellectual passion, with little dramatic interest; and it
is in this way that Milton has in a great measure constructed his
poem. That is not its fault, but its excellence. The fault is in
those who have no idea but of one kind of interest. But this question
would lead to a longer discussion than we have room for at present.
We shall conclude these extracts from Milton with two passages,
which have always appeared to us to be highly affecting, and to
contain a fine discrimination of character:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!</div>
      <div class='line'>Must I thus leave thee, Paradise? thus leave</div>
      <div class='line'>Thee, native soil, these happy walks and shades,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fit haunt of Gods? Where I had hope to spend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Quiet, though sad, the respite of that day</div>
      <div class='line'>That must be mortal to us both? O flowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>That never will in other climate grow,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>My early visitation and my last</div>
      <div class='line'>At even, which I bred up with tender hand</div>
      <div class='line'>From the first opening bud, and gave ye names,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank</div>
      <div class='line'>Your tribes, and water from th’ ambrosial fount?</div>
      <div class='line'>Thee, lastly, nuptial bow’r, by me adorn’d</div>
      <div class='line'>With what to sight or smell was sweet, from thee</div>
      <div class='line'>How shall I part, and whither wander down</div>
      <div class='line'>Into a lower world, to this obscure</div>
      <div class='line'>And wild? how shall we breathe in other air</div>
      <div class='line'>Less pure, accustom’d to immortal fruits?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This is the lamentation of <em>Eve</em> on being driven out of Paradise.
Adam’s reflections are in a different strain, and still finer. After
expressing his submission to the will of his Maker, he says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘This most afflicts me, that departing hence</div>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 29.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; OBSERVATIONS ON MR. WORDSWORTH’S POEM THE EXCURSION&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Aug. 21, 28, 1814.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The poem of The <cite>Excursion</cite> resembles that part of the country in
which the scene is laid. It has the same vastness and magnificence,
with the same nakedness and confusion. It has the same overwhelming,
oppressive power. It excites or recalls the same sensations
which those who have traversed that wonderful scenery must have
felt. We are surrounded with the constant sense and superstitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>awe of the collective power of matter, of the gigantic and eternal
forms of nature, on which, from the beginning of time, the hand of
man has made no impression. Here are no dotted lines, no hedge-row
beauties, no box-tree borders, no gravel walks, no square mechanic
inclosures; all is left loose and irregular in the rude chaos of aboriginal
nature. The boundaries of hill and valley are the poet’s only geography,
where we wander with him incessantly over deep beds of
moss and waving fern, amidst the troops of red-deer and wild animals.
Such is the severe simplicity of Mr. Wordsworth’s taste, that we
doubt whether he would not reject a druidical temple, or time-hallowed
ruin as too modern and artificial for his purpose. He only familiarises
himself or his readers with a stone, covered with lichens, which has
slept in the same spot of ground from the creation of the world, or
with the rocky fissure between two mountains caused by thunder, or
with a cavern scooped out by the sea. His mind is, as it were,
coëval with the primary forms of things; his imagination holds
immediately from nature, and ‘owes no allegiance’ but ‘to the
elements.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Excursion</cite> may be considered as a philosophical pastoral poem,—as
a scholastic romance. It is less a poem on the country, than on
the love of the country. It is not so much a description of natural
objects, as of the feelings associated with them; not an account of
the manners of rural life, but the result of the poet’s reflections on it.
He does not present the reader with a lively succession of images or
incidents, but paints the outgoings of his own heart, the shapings of
his own fancy. He may be said to create his own materials; his
thoughts are his real subject. His understanding broods over that
which is ‘without form and void,’ and ‘makes it pregnant.’ He
sees all things in himself. He hardly ever avails himself of remarkable
objects or situations, but, in general, rejects them as interfering
with the workings of his own mind, as disturbing the smooth, deep,
majestic current of his own feelings. Thus his descriptions of natural
scenery are not brought home distinctly to the naked eye by forms
and circumstances, but every object is seen through the medium of
innumerable recollections, is clothed with the haze of imagination
like a glittering vapour, is obscured with the excess of glory, has the
shadowy brightness of a waking dream. The image is lost in the
sentiment, as sound in the multiplication of echoes.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And visions, as prophetic eyes avow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hang on each leaf, and cling to every bough.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In describing human nature, Mr. Wordsworth equally shuns the
common ‘vantage-grounds of popular story, of striking incident, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>fatal catastrophe, as cheap and vulgar modes of producing an effect.
He scans the human race as the naturalist measures the earth’s zone,
without attending to the picturesque points of view, the abrupt inequalities
of surface. He contemplates the passions and habits of
men, not in their extremes, but in their first elements; their follies
and vices, not at their height, with all their embossed evils upon their
heads, but as lurking in embryo,—the seeds of the disorder inwoven
with our very constitution. He only sympathises with those simple
forms of feeling, which mingle at once with his own identity, or with
the stream of general humanity. To him the great and the small
are the same; the near and the remote; what appears, and what
only is. The general and the permanent, like the Platonic ideas, are
his only realities. All accidental varieties and individual contrasts
are lost in an endless continuity of feeling, like drops of water in the
ocean-stream! An intense intellectual egotism swallows up every
thing. Even the dialogues introduced in the present volume are
soliloquies of the same character, taking different views of the subject.
The recluse, the pastor, and the pedlar, are three persons in one poet.
We ourselves disapprove of these ‘interlocutions between Lucius and
Caius’ as impertinent babbling, where there is no dramatic distinction
of character. But the evident scope and tendency of Mr. Wordsworth’s
mind is the reverse of dramatic. It resists all change of
character, all variety of scenery, all the bustle, machinery, and pantomime
of the stage, or of real life,—whatever might relieve, or relax,
or change the direction of its own activity, jealous of all competition.
The power of his mind preys upon itself. It is as if there were
nothing but himself and the universe. He lives in the busy solitude
of his own heart; in the deep silence of thought. His imagination
lends life and feeling only to ‘the bare trees and mountains bare’;
peoples the viewless tracts of air, and converses with the silent clouds!</p>

<p class='c000'>We could have wished that our author had given to his work the
form of a didactic poem altogether, with only occasional digressions
or allusions to particular instances. But he has chosen to encumber
himself with a load of narrative and description, which sometimes
hinders the progress and effect of the general reasoning, and which,
instead of being inwoven with the text, would have come in better
in plain prose as notes at the end of the volume. Mr. Wordsworth,
indeed, says finely, and perhaps as truly as finely:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Exchange the shepherd’s frock of native grey</div>
      <div class='line'>For robes with regal purple tinged; convert</div>
      <div class='line'>The crook into a sceptre; give the pomp</div>
      <div class='line'>Of circumstance; and here the tragic Muse</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall find apt subjects for her highest art.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Amid the groves, beneath the shadowy hills,</div>
      <div class='line'>The generations are prepared; the pangs,</div>
      <div class='line'>The internal pangs, are ready; the dread strife</div>
      <div class='line'>Of poor humanity’s afflicted will</div>
      <div class='line'>Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But he immediately declines availing himself of these resources of
the rustic moralist: for the priest, who officiates as ‘the sad historian
of the pensive plain’ says in reply:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Our system is not fashioned to preclude</div>
      <div class='line'>That sympathy which you for others ask:</div>
      <div class='line'>And I could tell, not travelling for my theme</div>
      <div class='line'>Beyond the limits of these humble graves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of strange disasters; but I pass them by,</div>
      <div class='line'>Loth to disturb what Heaven hath hushed to peace.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is, in fact, in Mr. Wordsworth’s mind an evident repugnance
to admit anything that tells for itself, without the interpretation
of the poet,—a fastidious antipathy to immediate effect,—a systematic
unwillingness to share the palm with his subject. Where, however,
he has a subject presented to him, ‘such as the meeting soul may
pierce,’ and to which he does not grudge to lend the aid of his fine
genius, his powers of description and fancy seem to be little inferior
to those of his classical predecessor, Akenside. Among several
others which we might select we give the following passage, describing
the religion of ancient Greece:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In that fair clime, the lonely herdsman, stretch’d</div>
      <div class='line'>On the soft grass through half a summer’s day,</div>
      <div class='line'>With music lulled his indolent repose:</div>
      <div class='line'>And in some fit of weariness, if he,</div>
      <div class='line'>When his own breath was silent, chanced to hear</div>
      <div class='line'>A distant strain, far sweeter than the sounds</div>
      <div class='line'>Which his poor skill could make, his fancy fetch’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even from the blazing chariot of the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>A beardless youth, who touched a golden lute,</div>
      <div class='line'>And filled the illumined groves with ravishment.</div>
      <div class='line'>The nightly hunter, lifting up his eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Towards the crescent moon, with grateful heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Called on the lovely wanderer, who bestowed</div>
      <div class='line'>That timely light, to share his joyous sport:</div>
      <div class='line'>And hence, a beaming Goddess with her Nymphs</div>
      <div class='line'>Across the lawn and through the darksome grove,</div>
      <div class='line'>(Nor unaccompanied with tuneful notes</div>
      <div class='line'>By echo multiplied from rock or cave),</div>
      <div class='line'>Swept in the storm of chase, as moon and stars</div>
      <div class='line'>Glance rapidly along the clouded heavens,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>When winds are blowing strong. The traveller slaked</div>
      <div class='line'>His thirst from rill, or gushing fount, and thanked</div>
      <div class='line'>The Naiad. Sun beams, upon distant hills</div>
      <div class='line'>Gliding apace, with shadows in their train,</div>
      <div class='line'>Might, with small help from fancy, be transformed</div>
      <div class='line'>Into fleet Oreads, sporting visibly.</div>
      <div class='line'>The zephyrs fanning as they passed their wings</div>
      <div class='line'>Lacked not for love fair objects, whom they wooed</div>
      <div class='line'>With gentle whisper. Withered boughs grotesque,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stripped of their leaves and twigs by hoary age,</div>
      <div class='line'>From depth of shaggy covert peeping forth</div>
      <div class='line'>In the low vale, or on steep mountain side:</div>
      <div class='line'>And sometimes intermixed with stirring horns</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the live deer, or goat’s depending beard;</div>
      <div class='line'>These were the lurking satyrs, a wild brood</div>
      <div class='line'>Of gamesome Deities! or Pan himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>The simple shepherd’s awe-inspiring God.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing is one of a succession of splendid passages equally
enriched with philosophy and poetry, tracing the fictions of Eastern
mythology to the immediate intercourse of the imagination with
Nature, and to the habitual propensity of the human mind to endow
the outward forms of being with life and conscious motion. With
this expansive and animating principle, Mr. Wordsworth has forcibly,
but somewhat severely, contrasted the cold, narrow, lifeless spirit of
modern philosophy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘How, shall our great discoverers obtain</div>
      <div class='line'>From sense and reason less than these obtained,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though far misled? Shall men for whom our age</div>
      <div class='line'>Unbaffled powers of vision hath prepared,</div>
      <div class='line'>To explore the world without and world within,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be joyless as the blind? Ambitious souls—</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom earth at this late season hath produced</div>
      <div class='line'>To regulate the moving spheres, and weigh</div>
      <div class='line'>The planets in the hollow of their hand;</div>
      <div class='line'>And they who rather dive than soar, whose pains</div>
      <div class='line'>Have solved the elements, or analysed</div>
      <div class='line'>The thinking principle—shall they in fact</div>
      <div class='line'>Prove a degraded race? And what avails</div>
      <div class='line'>Renown, if their presumption make them such?</div>
      <div class='line'>Inquire of ancient wisdom; go, demand</div>
      <div class='line'>Of mighty nature, if ’twas ever meant</div>
      <div class='line'>That we should pry far off, yet be unraised;</div>
      <div class='line'>That we should pore, and dwindle as we pore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Viewing all objects unremittingly</div>
      <div class='line'>In disconnection dead and spiritless;</div>
      <div class='line'>And still dividing and dividing still</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Break down all grandeur, still unsatisfied</div>
      <div class='line'>With the perverse attempt, while littleness</div>
      <div class='line'>May yet become more little; waging thus</div>
      <div class='line'>An impious warfare with the very life</div>
      <div class='line'>Of our own souls! And if indeed there be</div>
      <div class='line'>An all-pervading spirit, upon whom</div>
      <div class='line'>Our dark foundations rest, could he design,</div>
      <div class='line'>That this magnificent effect of power,</div>
      <div class='line'>The earth we tread, the sky which we behold</div>
      <div class='line'>By day, and all the pomp which night reveals,</div>
      <div class='line'>That these—and that superior mystery,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our vital frame, so fearfully devised,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the dread soul within it—should exist</div>
      <div class='line'>Only to be examined, pondered, searched,</div>
      <div class='line'>Probed, vexed, and criticised—to be prized</div>
      <div class='line'>No more than as a mirror that reflects</div>
      <div class='line'>To proud Self-love her own intelligence?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>From the chemists and metaphysicians our author turns to the
laughing sage of France, Voltaire. ‘Poor gentleman, it fares no
better with him, for he’s a wit.’ We cannot, however, agree with
Mr. Wordsworth that <cite>Candide</cite> is <em>dull</em>. It is, if our author pleases,
‘the production of a scoffer’s pen,’ or it is any thing but dull. It
may not be proper in a grave, discreet, orthodox, promising young
divine, who studies his opinions in the contraction or distension of his
patron’s brow, to allow any merit to a work like <cite>Candide</cite>; but we
conceive that it would have been more manly in Mr. Wordsworth,
nor do we think it would have hurt the cause he espouses, if he had
blotted out the epithet, after it had peevishly escaped him. Whatsoever
savours of a little, narrow, inquisitorial spirit, does not sit well
on a poet and a man of genius. The prejudices of a philosopher are
not natural. There is a frankness and sincerity of opinion, which is
a paramount obligation in all questions of intellect, though it may not
govern the decisions of the spiritual courts, who may, however, be
safely left to take care of their own interests. There is a plain
directness and simplicity of understanding, which is the only security
against the evils of levity, on the one hand, or of hypocrisy on the
other. A speculative bigot is a solecism in the intellectual world.
We can assure Mr. Wordsworth, that we should not have bestowed
so much serious consideration on a single voluntary perversion of
language, but that our respect for his character makes us jealous of
his smallest faults!</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to his general philippic against the contractedness
and egotism of philosophical pursuits, we only object to its not being
carried further. We shall not affirm with Rousseau (his authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>would perhaps have little weight with Mr. Wordsworth)—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout
homme reflechi est mechant</span></i>‘; but we conceive that the same reasoning
which Mr. Wordsworth applies so eloquently and justly to the
natural philosopher and metaphysician may be extended to the
moralist, the divine, the politician, the orator, the artist, and even
the poet. And why so? Because wherever an intense activity is
given to any one faculty, it necessarily prevents the due and natural
exercise of others. Hence all those professions or pursuits, where
the mind is exclusively occupied with the ideas of things as they
exist in the imagination or understanding, as they call for the exercise
of intellectual activity, and not as they are connected with
practical good or evil, must check the genial expansion of the moral
sentiments and social affections; must lead to a cold and dry abstraction,
as they are found to suspend the animal functions, and relax the
bodily frame. Hence the complaint of the want of natural sensibility
and constitutional warmth of attachment in those persons who have
been devoted to the pursuit of any art or science,—of their restless
morbidity of temperament, and indifference to every thing that does not
furnish an occasion for the display of their mental superiority and the
gratification of their vanity. The philosophical poet himself, perhaps,
owes some of his love of nature to the opportunity it affords him of
analyzing his own feelings, and contemplating his own powers,—of
making every object about him a whole length mirror to reflect his
favourite thoughts, and of looking down on the frailties of others in
undisturbed leisure, and from a more dignified height.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most interesting parts of this work is that in which the
author treats of the French Revolution, and of the feelings connected
with it, in ingenuous minds, in its commencement and its progress.
The <em>solitary</em>,<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> who, by domestic calamities and disappointments, had
been cut off from society, and almost from himself, gives the
following account of the manner in which he was roused from his
melancholy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Thus was I reconverted to the world;</div>

<p class='c000'>In the application of these memorable lines, we should, perhaps,
differ a little from Mr. Wordsworth; nor can we indulge with him
in the fond conclusion afterwards hinted at, that one day <em>our</em> triumph,
the triumph of humanity and liberty, may be complete. For this
purpose, we think several things necessary which are impossible. It
is a consummation which cannot happen till the nature of things is
changed, till the many become as united as the <em>one</em>, till romantic
generosity shall be as common as gross selfishness, till reason shall
have acquired the obstinate blindness of prejudice, till the love of
power and of change shall no longer goad man on to restless action,
till passion and will, hope and fear, love and hatred, and the objects
proper to excite them, that is, alternate good and evil, shall no longer
sway the bosoms and businesses of men. All things move, not in
progress, but in a ceaseless round; our strength lies in our weakness;
our virtues are built on our vices; our faculties are as limited as our
being; nor can we lift man above his nature more than above the
earth he treads. But though we cannot weave over again the airy,
unsubstantial dream, which reason and experience have dispelled,</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What though the radiance, which was once so bright,</div>

      <div class='line'>Of glory in the grass, of splendour in the flower’:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>yet we will never cease, nor be prevented from returning on the
wings of imagination to that bright dream of our youth; that glad
dawn of the day-star of liberty; that spring-time of the world, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the hopes and expectations of the human race seemed opening in the
same gay career with our own; when France called her children to
partake her equal blessings beneath her laughing skies; when the
stranger was met in all her villages with dance and festive songs, in
celebration of a new and golden era; and when, to the retired and
contemplative student, the prospects of human happiness and glory
were seen ascending like the steps of Jacob’s ladder, in bright and
never-ending succession. The dawn of that day was suddenly overcast;
that season of hope is past; it is fled with the other dreams of
our youth, which we cannot recal, but has left behind it traces, which
are not to be effaced by Birth-day and Thanks-giving odes, or the
chaunting of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deums</span></i> in all the churches of Christendom. To
those hopes eternal regrets are due; to those who maliciously and
wilfully blasted them, in the fear that they might be accomplished, we
feel no less what we owe—hatred and scorn as lasting!</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 30.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Oct. 2, 1814.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Wordsworth’s writings exhibit all the internal power, without
the external form of poetry. He has scarcely any of the pomp and
decoration and scenic effect of poetry: no gorgeous palaces nor solemn
temples awe the imagination; no cities rise ‘with glistering spires and
pinnacles adorned’; we meet with no knights pricked forth on airy
steeds; no hair-breadth ‘scapes and perilous accidents by flood or field.
Either from the predominant habit of his mind not requiring the
stimulus of outward impressions, or from the want of an imagination
teeming with various forms, he takes the common every-day events
and objects of nature, or rather seeks those that are the most simple
and barren of effect; but he adds to them a weight of interest from
the resources of his own mind, which makes the most insignificant
things serious and even formidable. All other interests are absorbed
in the deeper interest of his own thoughts, and find the same level.
His mind magnifies the littleness of his subject, and raises its meanness;
lends it his strength, and clothes it with borrowed grandeur. With
him, a mole-hill, covered with wild thyme, assumes the importance of
‘the great vision of the guarded mount’: a puddle is filled with
preternatural faces, and agitated with the fiercest storms of passion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extreme simplicity which some persons have objected to in
Mr. Wordsworth’s poetry, is to be found only in the subject and the
style: the sentiments are subtle and profound. In the latter respect,
his poetry is as much above the common standard or capacity, as in the
other it is below it. His poems bear a distant resemblance to some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of Rembrandt’s landscapes, who, more than any other painter, created
the medium through which he saw nature, and out of the stump of
an old tree, a break in the sky, and a bit of water, could produce an
effect almost miraculous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wordsworth’s poems in general are the history of a refined
and contemplative mind, conversant only with itself and nature. An
intense feeling of the associations of this kind is the peculiar and
characteristic feature of all his productions. He has described the
love of nature better than any other poet. This sentiment, inly felt
in all its force, and sometimes carried to an excess, is the source both
of his strength and of his weakness. However we may sympathise
with Mr. Wordsworth in his attachment to groves and fields, we
cannot extend the same admiration to their inhabitants, or to the
manners of country life in general. We go along with him, while he
is the subject of his own narrative, but we take leave of him when he
makes pedlars and ploughmen his heroes and the interpreters of his
sentiments. It is, we think, getting into low company, and company,
besides, that we do not like. We take Mr. Wordsworth himself
for a great poet, a fine moralist, and a deep philosopher; but if he
insists on introducing us to a friend of his, a parish clerk, or the
barber of the village, who is as wise as himself, we must be excused
if we draw back with some little want of cordial faith. We are
satisfied with the friendship which subsisted between <em>Parson Adams</em>
and <em>Joseph Andrews</em>. The author himself lets out occasional hints
that all is not as it should be amongst these northern Arcadians.
Though, in general, he professes to soften the harsher features of
rustic vice, he has given us one picture of depraved and inveterate
selfishness, which we apprehend could only be found among the
inhabitants of these boasted mountain districts. The account of one
of his heroines concludes as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A sudden illness seiz’d her in the strength</div>
      <div class='line'>Of life’s autumnal season. Shall I tell</div>
      <div class='line'>How on her bed of death the matron lay,</div>
      <div class='line'>To Providence submissive, so she thought;</div>
      <div class='line'>But fretted, vexed, and wrought upon—almost</div>
      <div class='line'>To anger, by the malady that griped</div>
      <div class='line'>Her prostrate frame with unrelaxing power,</div>
      <div class='line'>As the fierce eagle fastens on the lamb.</div>
      <div class='line'>She prayed, she moaned—her husband’s sister watched</div>
      <div class='line'>Her dreary pillow, waited on her needs;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet the very sound of that kind foot</div>
      <div class='line'>Was anguish to her ears! “And must she rule</div>
      <div class='line'>Sole mistress of this house when I am gone?</div>
      <div class='line'>Sit by my fire—possess what I possessed—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Tend what I tended—calling it her own!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Enough;—I fear too much. Of nobler feeling</div>
      <div class='line'>Take this example:—One autumnal evening,</div>
      <div class='line'>While she was yet in prime of health and strength,</div>
      <div class='line'>I well remember, while I passed her door,</div>
      <div class='line'>Musing with loitering step, and upward eye</div>
      <div class='line'>Turned tow’rds the planet Jupiter, that hung</div>
      <div class='line'>Above the centre of the vale, a voice</div>
      <div class='line'>Roused me, her voice;—it said, “That glorious star</div>
      <div class='line'>In its untroubled element will shine</div>
      <div class='line'>As now it shines, when we are laid in earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And safe from all our sorrows.” She is safe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And her uncharitable acts, I trust,</div>
      <div class='line'>And harsh unkindnesses, are all forgiven;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though, in this vale, remembered with deep awe!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We think it is pushing our love of the admiration of natural objects
a good deal too far, to make it a set-off against a story like the
preceding.</p>

<p class='c000'>All country people hate each other. They have so little comfort,
that they envy their neighbours the smallest pleasure or advantage,
and nearly grudge themselves the necessaries of life. From not being
accustomed to enjoyment, they become hardened and averse to it—stupid,
for want of thought—selfish, for want of society. There is
nothing good to be had in the country, or, if there is, they will not
let you have it. They had rather injure themselves than oblige any
one else. Their common mode of life is a system of wretchedness
and self-denial, like what we read of among barbarous tribes. You
live out of the world. You cannot get your tea and sugar without
sending to the next town for it: you pay double, and have it of the
worst quality. The small-beer is sure to be sour—the milk skimmed—the
meat bad, or spoiled in the cooking. You cannot do a single
thing you like; you cannot walk out or sit at home, or write or read,
or think or look as if you did, without being subject to impertinent
curiosity. The apothecary annoys you with his complaisance; the
parson with his superciliousness. If you are poor, you are despised;
if you are rich, you are feared and hated. If you do any one a
favour, the whole neighbourhood is up in arms; the clamour is like
that of a rookery; and the person himself, it is ten to one, laughs
at you for your pains, and takes the first opportunity of shewing you
that he labours under no uneasy sense of obligation. There is a
perpetual round of mischief-making and backbiting for want of any
better amusement. There are no shops, no taverns, no theatres, no
opera, no concerts, no pictures, no public-buildings, no crowded
streets, no noise of coaches, or of courts of law,—neither courtiers nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>courtesans, no literary parties, no fashionable routs, no society, no
books, or knowledge of books. Vanity and luxury are the civilisers
of the world, and sweeteners of human life. Without objects either
of pleasure or action, it grows harsh and crabbed: the mind becomes
stagnant, the affections callous, and the eye dull. Man left to himself
soon degenerates into a very disagreeable person. Ignorance is
always bad enough; but rustic ignorance is intolerable. Aristotle has
observed, that tragedy purifies the affections by terror and pity. If
so, a company of tragedians should be established at the public
expence, in every village or hundred, as a better mode of education
than either Bell’s or Lancaster’s. The benefits of knowledge are
never so well understood as from seeing the effects of ignorance, in
their naked, undisguised state, upon the common country people.
Their selfishness and insensibility are perhaps less owing to the hardships
and privations, which make them, like people out at sea in a
boat, ready to devour one another, than to their having no idea of
anything beyond themselves and their immediate sphere of action.
They have no knowledge of, and consequently can take no interest
in, anything which is not an object of their senses, and of their daily
pursuits. They hate all strangers, and have generally a nickname
for the inhabitants of the next village. The two young noblemen
in Guzman d’Alfarache, who went to visit their mistresses only a
league out of Madrid, were set upon by the peasants, who came round
them calling out, ‘<em>A wolf</em>.’ Those who have no enlarged or
liberal ideas, can have no disinterested or generous sentiments. Persons
who are in the habit of reading novels and romances, are compelled
to take a deep interest in, and to have their affections strongly
excited by, fictitious characters and imaginary situations; their thoughts
and feelings are constantly carried out of themselves, to persons they
never saw, and things that never existed: history enlarges the mind,
by familiarising us with the great vicissitudes of human affairs, and
the catastrophes of states and kingdoms; the study of morals accustoms
us to refer our actions to a general standard of right and wrong;
and abstract reasoning, in general, strengthens the love of truth, and
produces an inflexibility of principle which cannot stoop to low trick
and cunning. Books, in Lord Bacon’s phrase, are ‘a discipline of
humanity.’ Country people have none of these advantages, nor any
others to supply the place of them. Having no circulating libraries
to exhaust their love of the marvellous, they amuse themselves with
fancying the disasters and disgraces of their particular acquaintance.
Having no hump-backed <em>Richard</em> to excite their wonder and abhorrence,
they make themselves a bugbear of their own, out of the first
obnoxious person they can lay their hands on. Not having the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>fictitious distresses and gigantic crimes of poetry to stimulate their
imagination and their passions, they vent their whole stock of spleen,
malice, and invention, on their friends and next-door neighbours.
They get up a little pastoral drama at home, with fancied events, but
real characters. All their spare time is spent in manufacturing and
propagating the lie for the day, which does its office, and expires.
The next day is spent in the same manner. It is thus that they
embellish the simplicity of rural life! The common people in civilised
countries are a kind of domesticated savages. They have not the
wild imagination, the passions, the fierce energies, or dreadful vicissitudes
of the savage tribes, nor have they the leisure, the indolent
enjoyments and romantic superstitions, which belonged to the pastoral
life in milder climates, and more remote periods of society. They are
taken out of a state of nature, without being put in possession of the
refinements of art. The customs and institutions of society cramp
their imaginations without giving them knowledge. If the inhabitants
of the mountainous districts described by Mr. Wordsworth are less
gross and sensual than others, they are more selfish. Their egotism
becomes more concentrated, as they are more insulated, and their
purposes more inveterate, as they have less competition to struggle
with. The weight of matter which surrounds them, crushes the finer
sympathies. Their minds become hard and cold, like the rocks
which they cultivate. The immensity of their mountains makes the
human form appear little and insignificant. Men are seen crawling
between Heaven and earth, like insects to their graves. Nor do they
regard one another more than flies on a wall. Their physiognomy
expresses the materialism of their character, which has only one
principle—rigid self-will. They move on with their eyes and foreheads
fixed, looking neither to the right nor to the left, with a heavy
slouch in their gait, and seeming as if nothing would divert them
from their path. We do not admire this plodding pertinacity, always
directed to the main chance. There is nothing which excites so
little sympathy in our minds, as exclusive selfishness. If our theory
is wrong, at least it is taken from pretty close observation, and is, we
think, confirmed by Mr. Wordsworth’s own account.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the stories contained in the latter part of the volume, we like
that of the Whig and Jacobite friends, and of the good knight, Sir
Alfred Irthing, the best. The last reminded us of a fine sketch of
a similar character in the beautiful poem of <cite>Hart Leap Well</cite>. To
conclude,—if the skill with which the poet had chosen his materials
had been equal to the power which he has undeniably exerted over
them, if the objects (whether persons or things) which he makes
use of as the vehicle of his sentiments, had been such as to convey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>them in all their depth and force, then the production before us might
indeed ‘have proved a monument,’ as he himself wishes it, worthy
of the author, and of his country. Whether, as it is, this very original
and powerful performance may not rather remain like one of those
stupendous but half-finished structures, which have been suffered to
moulder into decay, because the cost and labour attending them
exceeded their use or beauty, we feel that it would be presumptuous
in us to determine.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 31.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; CHARACTER OF THE LATE MR. PITT<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c011'>The character of Mr. Pitt was, perhaps, one of the most singular
that ever existed. With few talents, and fewer virtues, he acquired
and preserved, in one of the most trying situations, and in spite of all
opposition, the highest reputation for the possession of every moral
excellence, and as having carried the attainments of eloquence and
wisdom as far as human abilities could go. This he did (strange as
it may appear) by a negation (together with the common virtues) of
the common vices of human nature, and by the complete negation of
every other talent that might interfere with the only ones which he
possessed in a supreme degree, and which, indeed, may be made to
include the appearance of all others,—an artful use of words, and a
certain dexterity of logical arrangement. In these alone his power
consisted; and the defect of all other qualities, which usually constitute
greatness, contributed to the more complete success of these.
Having no strong feelings, no distinct perceptions,—his mind having
no link, as it were, to connect it with the world of external nature,
every subject presented to him nothing more than a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</span></i>, on
which he was at liberty to lay whatever colouring of language he
pleased; having no general principles, no comprehensive views of
things, no moral habits of thinking, no system of action, there was
nothing to hinder him from pursuing any particular purpose by any
means that offered; having never any plan, he could not be convicted
of inconsistency, and his own pride and obstinacy were the only rules
of his conduct. Without insight into human nature, without sympathy
with the passions of men, or apprehension of their real designs, he
seemed perfectly insensible to the consequences of things, and would
believe nothing till it actually happened. The fog and haze in
which he saw every thing communicated itself to others; and the
total indistinctness and uncertainty of his own ideas tended to confound
the perceptions of his hearers more effectually than the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>ingenious misrepresentation could have done. Indeed, in defending
his conduct, he never seemed to consider himself as at all responsible
for the success of his measures, or to suppose that future events were
in our own power; but that, as the best-laid schemes might fail, and
there was no providing against all possible contingencies, this was
sufficient excuse for our plunging at once into any dangerous or
absurd enterprise without the least regard to consequences. His
reserved logic confined itself solely to the <em>possible</em> and the <em>impossible</em>,
and he appeared to regard the <em>probable</em> and <em>improbable</em>, the only
foundation of moral prudence or political wisdom, as beneath the
notice of a profound statesman; as if the pride of the human intellect
were concerned in never entrusting itself with subjects, where it may be
compelled to acknowledge its weakness. Nothing could ever drive
him out of his dull forms, and naked generalities; which, as they are
susceptible neither of degree nor variation, are therefore equally
applicable to every emergency that can happen: and in the most
critical aspect of affairs, he saw nothing but the same flimsy web of
remote possibilities and metaphysical uncertainty. In his mind, the
wholesome pulp of practical wisdom and salutary advice was immediately
converted into the dry chaff and husks of a miserable logic.
From his manner of reasoning, he seemed not to have believed that
the truth of his statements depended on the reality of the facts, but
that the facts themselves depended on the order in which he arranged
them in words: you would not suppose him to be agitating a serious
question, which had real grounds to go upon, but to be declaiming
upon an imaginary thesis, proposed as an exercise in the schools. He
never set himself to examine the force of the objections that were
brought against him, or attempted to defend his measures upon clear,
solid grounds of his own; but constantly contented himself with
first gravely stating the logical form, or dilemma to which the question
reduced itself; and then, after having declared his opinion, proceeded
to amuse his hearers by a series of rhetorical common-places,
connected together in grave, sonorous, and elaborately constructed
periods, without ever shewing their real application to the subject in
dispute. Thus, if any member of the opposition disapproved of any
measure, and enforced his objections by pointing out the many evils
with which it was fraught, or the difficulties attending its execution,
his only answer was, ‘that it was true there might be inconveniences
attending the measure proposed, but we were to remember,
that every expedient that could be devised might be said to be nothing
more than a choice of difficulties, and that all that human prudence could
do, was to consider on which side the advantages lay; that, for his
part, he conceived that the present measure was attended with more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>advantages and fewer disadvantages than any other that could be
adopted; that it we were diverted from our object by every appearance
of difficulty, the wheels of government would be clogged by
endless delays and imaginary grievances; that most of the objections
made to the measure appeared to him to be trivial, others of them
unfounded and improbable; or that, if a scheme, free from all these
objections, could be proposed, it might, after all, prove inefficient; while,
in the meantime, a material object remained unprovided for, or the
opportunity of action was lost.’ This mode of reasoning is admirably
described by Hobbes, in speaking of the writings of some of the
schoolmen, of whom he says that ‘they had learned the trick of
imposing what they list upon their readers, and declining the force of
true reason by verbal forks, that is, distinctions, which signify nothing,
but serve only to astonish the multitude of ignorant men.’
That what we have here stated comprehends the whole force of his
mind, which consisted solely in this evasive dexterity and perplexing
formality, assisted by a copiousness of words and common-place topics,
will, we think, be evident to any one who carefully looks over his
speeches, undazzled by the reputation or personal influence of the
speaker. It will be in vain to look in them for any of the common
proofs of human genius or wisdom. He has not left behind him a
single memorable saying,—not one profound maxim,—one solid observation,—one
forcible description,—one beautiful thought,—one humorous
picture,—one affecting sentiment. He has made no addition
whatever to the stock of human knowledge. He did not possess any
one of those faculties which contribute to the instruction and delight
of mankind,—depth of understanding, imagination, sensibility, wit,
vivacity, clear and solid judgment. But it may be asked, If these
qualities are not to be found in him, where are we to look for them?
and we may be required to point out instances of them. We shall
answer then, that he had none of the abstract, legislative wisdom,
refined sagacity, or rich, impetuous, high-wrought imagination of
Burke; the manly eloquence, exact knowledge, vehemence, and
natural simplicity of Fox; the ease, brilliancy, and acuteness of
Sheridan. It is not merely that he had not all these qualities in the
degree that they were severally possessed by his rivals, but he had
not any of them in any remarkable degree. His reasoning is a
technical arrangement of unmeaning common-places, his eloquence
rhetorical, his style monotonous and artificial. If he could pretend
to any one excellence more than another, it was to taste
in composition. There is certainly nothing low, nothing puerile,
nothing far-fetched or abrupt in his speeches; there is a kind of
faultless regularity pervading them throughout; but in the confined,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>formal, passive mode of eloquence which he adopted, it seemed rather
more difficult to commit errors than to avoid them. A man who
is determined never to move out of the beaten road cannot lose his
way. However, habit, joined to the peculiar mechanical memory
which he possessed, carried this correctness to a degree which, in an
extemporaneous speaker, was almost miraculous; he, perhaps, hardly
ever uttered a sentence that was not perfectly regular and connected.
In this respect, he not only had the advantage over his own contemporaries,
but perhaps no one that ever lived equalled him in this
singular faculty. But for this, he would always have passed for a
common man; and to this the constant sameness, and, if we may so
say, vulgarity of his ideas, must have contributed not a little, as there
was nothing to distract his mind from this one object of his unintermitted
attention; and as, even in his choice of words, he never aimed
at any thing more than a certain general propriety and stately uniformity
of style. His talents were exactly fitted for the situation in which
he was placed; where it was his business not to overcome others, but
to avoid being overcome. He was able to baffle opposition, not
from strength or firmness, but from the evasive ambiguity and impalpable
nature of his resistance, which gave no hold to the rude
grasp of his opponents: no force could bind the loose phantom, and
his mind (though ‘not matchless, and his pride humbled by such
rebuke’) soon rose from defeat unhurt,</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 32.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON RELIGIOUS HYPOCRISY&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Oct. 9, 1814.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Religion either makes men wise and virtuous, or it makes them
set up false pretences to both. In the latter case, it makes them
hypocrites to themselves as well as others. Religion is, in grosser
minds, an enemy to self-knowledge. The consciousness of the
presence of an all-powerful Being, who is both the witness and judge
of every thought, word, and action, where it does not produce its
proper effect, forces the religious man to practise every mode of
deceit upon himself with respect to his real character and motives;
for it is only by being wilfully blind to his own faults, that he can
suppose they will escape the eye of Omniscience. Consequently,
the whole business of a religious man’s life, if it does not conform
to the strict line of his duty, may be said to be to gloss over his
errors to himself, and to invent a thousand shifts and palliations, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>order to hoodwink the Almighty. While he is sensible of his own
delinquency, he knows that it cannot escape the penetration of his
invisible Judge; and the distant penalty annexed to every offence,
though not sufficient to make him desist from the commission of it,
will not suffer him to rest easy, till he has made some compromise
with his own conscience as to his motives for committing it. As
far as relates to this world, a cunning knave may take a pride in the
imposition he practises upon others; and, instead of striving to conceal
his true character from himself, may chuckle with inward satisfaction
at the folly of those who are not wise enough to detect it. ‘But ’tis
not so above.’ This shallow, skin-deep hypocrisy will not serve the
turn of the religious devotee, who is ‘compelled to give in evidence
against himself,’ and who must first become the dupe of his own
imposture, before he can flatter himself with the hope of concealment,
as children hide their eyes with their hands, and fancy that no one
can see them. Religious people often pray very heartily for the
forgiveness of a ‘multitude of trespasses and sins,’ as a mark of their
humility, but we never knew them admit any one fault in particular,
or acknowledge themselves in the wrong in any instance whatever.
The natural jealousy of self-love is in them heightened by the fear of
damnation, and they plead <em>Not Guilty</em> to every charge brought against
them, with all the conscious terrors of a criminal at the bar. It is
for this reason that the greatest hypocrites in the world are religious
hypocrites.</p>

<p class='c000'>This quality, as it has been sometimes found united with the
clerical character, is known by the name of <em>Priestcraft</em>. The
Ministers of Religion are perhaps more liable to this vice than any
other class of people. They are obliged to assume a greater degree
of sanctity, though they have it not, and to screw themselves up to
an unnatural pitch of severity and self-denial. They must keep a
constant guard over themselves, have an eye always to their own
persons, never relax in their gravity, nor give the least scope to their
inclinations. A single slip, if discovered, may be fatal to them.
Their influence and superiority depend on their pretensions to virtue
and piety; and they are tempted to draw liberally on the funds of
credulity and ignorance allotted for their convenient support. All
this cannot be very friendly to downright simplicity of character.
Besides, they are so accustomed to inveigh against the vices of others,
that they naturally forget that they have any of their own to correct.
They see vice as an object always out of themselves, with which they
have no other concern than to denounce and stigmatise it. They are
only reminded of it <em>in the third person</em>. They as naturally associate
sin and its consequences with their flocks as a pedagogue associates a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>false concord and flogging with his scholars. If we may so express
it, they serve as conductors to the lightning of divine indignation,
and have only to point the thunders of the law at others. They
identify themselves with that perfect system of faith and morals, of
which they are the professed teachers, and regard any imputation
on their conduct as an indirect attack on the function to which they
belong, or as compromising the authority under which they act. It
is only the head of the Popish church who assumes the title of
<em>God’s Vicegerent upon Earth</em>; but the feeling is nearly common
to all the oracular interpreters of the will of Heaven—from the
successor of St. Peter down to the simple, unassuming Quaker, who,
disclaiming the imposing authority of title and office, yet fancies
himself the immediate organ of a preternatural impulse, and affects to
speak only as the spirit moves him.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is another way in which the formal profession of religion
aids hypocrisy, by erecting a secret tribunal, to which those who
affect a more than ordinary share of it can (in case of need) appeal
from the judgments of men. The religious impostor, reduced to his
last shift, and having no other way left to avoid the most ‘open and
apparent shame,’ rejects the fallible decisions of the world, and
thanks God that there is one who knows the heart. He is amenable
to a higher jurisdiction, and while all is well with Heaven, he can
pity the errors, and smile at the malice of his enemies! Whatever
cuts men off from their dependence on common opinion or obvious
appearances, must open a door to evasion and cunning, by setting up
a standard of right and wrong in every one’s own breast, of the truth
of which nobody can judge but the person himself. There are some
fine instances in the old plays and novels (the best commentaries on
human nature) of the effect of this principle, in giving the last finishing
to the character of duplicity. Miss Harris, in Fielding’s <cite>Amelia</cite>,
is one of the most striking. Molière’s <cite>Tartuffe</cite> is another instance of
the facility with which religion may be perverted to the purposes
of the most flagrant hypocrisy. It is an impenetrable fastness, to
which this worthy person, like so many others, retires without the
fear of pursuit. It is an additional disguise, in which he wraps
himself up like a cloak. It is a stalking-horse, which is ready on
all occasions,—an invisible conscience, which goes about with him,—his
good genius, that becomes surety for him in all difficulties,—swears
to the purity of his motives,—extricates him out of the most desperate
circumstances,—baffles detection, and furnishes a plea to which there
is no answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same sort of reasoning will account for the old remark, that
persons who are stigmatised as non-conformists to the established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>religion, Jews, Presbyterians, etc., are more disposed to this vice
than their neighbours. They are inured to the contempt of the
world, and steeled against its prejudices: and the same indifference
which fortifies them against the unjust censures of mankind, may be
converted, as occasion requires, into a screen for the most pitiful
conduct. They have no cordial sympathy with others, and, therefore,
no sincerity in their intercourse with them. It is the necessity of
concealment, in the first instance, that produces, and is, in some
measure, an excuse for, the habit of hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hypocrisy, as it is connected with cowardice, seems to imply
weakness of body or want of spirit. The impudence and insensibility
which belong to it, ought to suppose robustness of constitution.
There is certainly a very successful and formidable class of sturdy,
jolly, able-bodied hypocrites, the Friar Johns of the profession.
Raphael has represented Elymas the Sorcerer, with a hard iron visage,
and large uncouth figure, made up of bones and muscles; as one not
troubled with weak nerves or idle scruples—as one who repelled all
sympathy with others—who was not to be jostled out of his course
by their censures or suspicions—and who could break with ease
through the cobweb snares which he had laid for the credulity of
others, without being once entangled in his own delusions. His
outward form betrays the hard, unimaginative, self-willed understanding
of the sorcerer.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 33.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON THE LITERARY CHARACTER&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Oct. 28, 1813.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The following remarks are prefixed to the account of Baron Grimm’s
Correspondence in a late number of a celebrated Journal:-</p>

<p class='c000'>‘There is nothing more exactly painted in these graphical volumes,
than the character of M. Grimm himself; and the beauty of it is,
that, as there is nothing either natural or peculiar about it, it may
stand for the character of all the wits and philosophers he frequented.
He had more wit, perhaps, and more sound sense and information,
than the greatest part of the society in which he lived; but the
leading traits belong to the whole class, and to all classes, indeed,
in similar situations, in every part of the world. Whenever there
is a very large assemblage of persons who have no other occupation
but to amuse themselves, there will infallibly be generated acuteness
of intellect, refinement of manners, and good taste in conversation;
and, with the same certainty, all profound thought, and all serious
affection, will be discarded from their society.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The multitude of persons and things that force themselves on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>attention in such a scene, and the rapidity with which they succeed
each other, and pass away, prevent any one from making a deep or
permanent impression; and the mind, having never been tasked to
any course of application, and long habituated to this lively succession
and variety of objects, comes at last to require the excitement of
perpetual change, and to find a multiplicity of friends as indispensable
as a multiplicity of amusements. Thus the characteristics of large
and polished society come almost inevitably to be, wit and heartlessness—acuteness
and perpetual derision. The same impatience of uniformity,
and passion for variety, which give so much grace to their
conversation, by excluding all tediousness and pertinacious wrangling,
make them incapable of dwelling for many minutes on the feelings
and concerns of any one individual; while the constant pursuit of
little gratifications, and the weak dread of all uneasy sensations, render
them equally averse from serious sympathy and deep thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The whole style and tone of this publication affords the most
striking illustration of these general remarks. From one end of it
to the other, it is a display of the most complete heartlessness, and
the most uninterrupted levity. It chronicles the deaths of half the
author’s acquaintance, and makes jests upon them all; and is much
more serious in discussing the merits of an opera-dancer, than in considering
the evidence for the being of a God, or the first foundations
of morality. Nothing, indeed, can be more just or conclusive than
the remark that is forced from M. Grimm himself, upon the utter
carelessness, and instant oblivion, that followed the death of one of
the most distinguished, active, and amiable members of his coterie:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tant il est vrai que ce que nous appelons <em>la société</em>, est ce qu’il y
a de plus léger, plus ingrat, et de plus frivole au monde!</span>”’</p>

<p class='c000'>These remarks, though shrewd and sensible in themselves, apply
rather to the character of M. Grimm and his friends as men of the
world, after their initiation into the refined society of Paris and the
great world, than as mere men of letters. There is, however, a
character which every man of letters has before he comes into society,
and which he carries into the world with him, which we shall here
attempt to describe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weaknesses and vices that arise from a constant intercourse
with books, are in certain respects the same with those which arise
from daily intercourse with the world; yet each has a character and
operation of its own, which may either counteract or aggravate the
tendency of the other. The same dissipation of mind, the same listlessness,
languor, and indifference, may be produced by both, but
they are produced in different ways, and exhibit very different appearances.
The defects of the literary character proceed, not from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>frivolity and voluptuous indolence, but from the overstrained exertion
of the faculties, from abstraction and refinement. A man without
talents or education might mingle in the same society, might give in
to all the gaiety and foppery of the age, might see the same ‘multiplicity
of persons and things,’ but would not become a wit and a
philosopher for all that. As far as the change of actual objects, the
real variety and dissipation goes, there is no difference between
M. Grimm and a courtier of Francis <span class='fss'>I.</span>—between the consummate
philosopher and the giddy girl—between Paris, amidst the barbaric
refinements of the middle of the eighteenth century, and any other
metropolis at any other period. It is in the <em>ideal</em> change of objects,
in the <em>intellectual</em> dissipation of literature and of literary society, that
we are to seek for the difference. The very same languor and listlessness
which, in fashionable life, are owing to the rapid ‘succession
of persons and things,’ may be found, and even in a more intense
degree, in the most recluse student, who has no knowledge whatever
of the great world, who has never been present at the sallies of a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit souper</span></i>, or complimented a lady on presenting her with a bouquet.
It is the province of literature to anticipate the dissipation of real
objects, and to increase it. It creates a fictitious restlessness and
craving after variety, by creating a fictitious world around us, and by
hurrying us, not only through all the mimic scenes of life, but by
plunging us into the endless labyrinths of imagination. Thus the
common indifference produced by the distraction of successive amusements,
is superseded by a general indifference to surrounding objects,
to real persons and things, occasioned by the disparity between the
world of our imagination and that without us. The scenes of real
life are not got up in the same style of magnificence; they want
dramatic illusion and effect. The high-wrought feelings require all
the concomitant and romantic circumstances which fancy can bring
together to satisfy them, and cannot find them in any given object.
M. Grimm was not, by his own account, <em>born</em> a lover; but even
supposing him to have been, in gallantry of temper, a very Amadis,
would it have been necessary that the enthusiasm of a philosopher and
a man of genius should have run the gauntlet of all the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnes fortunes</span></i>
of Paris to evaporate into insensibility and indifference? Would not
a Clarissa, a new Eloise, a Cassandra, or a Berenice, have produced
the same mortifying effects on a person of his great critical and acumen
and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">virtù</span>? Where, O where would he find the rocks of Meillerie
in the precincts of the Palais Royal, or on what lips would Julia’s
kisses grow? Who, after wandering with Angelica, or having seen
the heavenly face of Una, might not meet with impunity a whole
circle of literary ladies? Cowley’s mistresses reigned by turns in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>poet’s fancy, and the beauties of King Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> perplex the eye in
the preference of their charms as much now as they ever did. One
trifling coquette only drives out another; but Raphael’s Galatea kills
the whole race of pertness and vulgarity at once. After ranging in
dizzy mazes, through the regions of imaginary beauty, the mind sinks
down, breathless and exhausted, on the earth. In common minds,
indifference is produced by mixing with the world. Authors and
artists bring it into the world with them. The disappointment of the
ideal enthusiast is indeed greatest at first, and he grows reconciled to
his situation by degrees; whereas the mere man of the world becomes
more dissatisfied and fastidious, and more of a misanthrope, the longer
he lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is much the same in friendships founded on literary motives.
Literary men are not attached to the persons of their friends, but to
their minds. They look upon them in the same light as on the books
in their library, and read them till they are tired. In casual acquaintances
friendship grows out of habit. Mutual kindnesses beget mutual
attachment; and numberless little local occurrences in the course of a
long intimacy, furnish agreeable topics of recollection, and are almost
the only sources of conversation among such persons. They have an
immediate pleasure in each other’s company. But in literature nothing
of this kind takes place. Petty and local circumstances are beneath
the dignity of philosophy. Nothing will go down but wit or wisdom.
The mind is kept in a perpetual state of violent exertion and expectation,
and as there cannot always be a fresh supply of stimulus to excite
it, as the same remarks or the same <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mots</span></i> come to be often
repeated, or others so like them, that we can easily anticipate the
effect, and are no longer surprised into admiration, we begin to relax
in the frequency of our visits, and the heartiness of our welcome.
When we are tired of a book we can lay it down, but we cannot so
easily put our friends on the shelf when we grow weary of their
society. The necessity of keeping up appearances, therefore, adds to
the dissatisfaction on both sides, and at length irritates indifference
into contempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the help of arts and science, everything finds an ideal level.
Ideas assume the place of realities, and realities sink into nothing.
Actual events and objects produce little or no effect on the mind,
when it has been long accustomed to draw its strongest interest from
constant contemplation. It is necessary that it should, as it were,
recollect itself—that it should call out its internal resources, and refine
upon its own feelings—place the object at a distance, and embellish it
at pleasure. By degrees all things are made to serve as hints, and
occasions for the exercise of intellectual activity. It was on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>principle that the sentimental Frenchman left his Mistress, in order
that he might think of her. Cicero ceased to mourn for the loss of
his daughter, when he recollected how fine an opportunity it would
afford him to write an eulogy to her memory; and Mr. Shandy
lamented over the death of Master Bobby much in the same manner.
The insensibility of Authors, etc., to domestic and private calamities
has been often carried to a ludicrous excess, but it is less than it
appears to be. The genius of philosophy is not yet <em>quite</em> understood.
For instance, the man who might seem at the moment undisturbed
by the death of a wife or mistress, would perhaps never walk out on a
fine evening as long as he lived, without recollecting her; and a
disappointment in love that ‘heaves no sigh and sheds no tear,’ may
penetrate to the heart, and remain fixed there ever after. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hæret lateri
lethalis arundo.</span></i> The blow is felt only by reflection, the rebound is
fatal. Our feelings become more ideal; the impression of the
moment is less violent, but the effect is more general and permanent.
Those whom we love best, take nearly the same rank in our estimation
as the heroine of a favourite novel! Indeed, after all, compared with
the genuine feelings of nature, ‘clad in flesh and blood,’ with real
passions and affections, conversant about real objects, the life of a
mere man of letters and sentiment appears to be at best but a living
death; a dim twilight existence: a sort of wandering about in an
Elysian fields of our own making; a refined, spiritual, disembodied
state, like that of the ghosts of Homer’s heroes, who, we are told,
would gladly have exchanged situations with the meanest peasant upon
earth!<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The moral character of men of letters depends very much upon the
same principles. All actions are seen through that general medium
which reduces them to individual insignificance. Nothing fills or
engrosses the mind—nothing seems of sufficient importance to interfere
with our present inclination. Prejudices, as well as attachments, lose
their hold upon us, and we palter with our duties as we please.
Moral obligations, by being perpetually refined upon, and discussed,
lose their force and efficacy, become mere dry distinctions of the
understanding,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Play round the head, but never reach the heart.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Opposite reasons and consequences balance one another, while appetite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>or interest turns the scale. Hence the severe sarcasm of Rousseau,
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout homme reflechi est mechant</span></i>.’ In fact, it must be confessed, that,
as all things produce their extremes, so excessive refinement tends to
produce equal grossness. The tenuity of our intellectual desires
leaves a void in the mind which requires to be filled up by coarser
gratification, and that of the senses is always at hand. They alone
always retain their strength. There is not a greater mistake than the
common supposition, that intellectual pleasures are capable of endless
repetition, and physical ones not so. The one, indeed, may be spread
out over a greater surface, they may be dwelt upon and kept in mind
at will, and for that very reason they wear out, and pall by comparison,
and require perpetual variety. Whereas the physical gratification
only occupies us at the moment, is, as it were, absorbed in itself, and
forgotten as soon as it is over, and when it returns is <em>as good as new</em>.
No one could ever read the same book for any length of time without
being tired of it, but a man is never tired of his meals, however little
variety his table may have to boast. This reasoning is equally true
of all persons who have given much of their time to study and abstracted
speculations. Grossness and sensuality have been marked
with no less triumph in the religious devotee than in the professed
philosopher. The perfect joys of heaven do not satisfy the cravings
of nature; and the good Canon in Gil Blas might be opposed with
effect to some of the portraits in M. Grimm’s Correspondence.</p>

shall in this number attempt a description of another class of the
community, who may be called (by way of distinction) common-place

their own, and do not pretend to have any; the latter are a set of
people who have no opinions of their own, but who affect to have
one upon every subject you can mention. The former are a very

by proxy, and talks by rote. He differs with you, not because he
thinks you are in the wrong, but because he thinks somebody else
will think so. Nay, it would be well if he stopped here; but he
will undertake to misrepresent you by anticipation, lest others should
misunderstand you, and will set you right, not only in opinions which
you have, but in those which you may be supposed to have. Thus, if
you say that <em>Bottom</em> the weaver is a character that has not had justice
done to it, he shakes his head, is afraid you will be thought extravagant,
and wonders you should think the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>
the finest of all Shakspeare’s plays. He judges of matters of taste
and reasoning as he does of dress and fashion, by the prevailing tone
of good company; and you would as soon persuade him to give up
any sentiment that is current there, as to wear the hind part of his
coat before. By the best company, of which he is perpetually talking,
he means persons who live on their own estates, and other people’s
ideas. By the opinion of the world, to which he pays and expects
you to pay great deference, he means that of a little circle of his own,
where he hears and is heard. Again, <em>good sense</em> is a phrase constantly
in his mouth, by which he does not mean his own sense or that of
anybody else, but the opinions of a number of persons who have
agreed to take their opinions on trust from others. If any one
observes that there is something better than common sense, viz., <em>uncommon</em>
sense, he thinks this a bad joke. If you object to the opinions
of the majority, as often arising from ignorance or prejudice, he
appeals from them to the sensible and well-informed; and if you say
there may be other persons as sensible and well informed as himself
and his friends, he smiles at your presumption. If you attempt to
prove anything to him, it is in vain, for he is not thinking of what
you say, but of what will be thought of it. The stronger your
reasons, the more incorrigible he thinks you; and he looks upon any
attempt to expose his gratuitous assumptions as the wandering of a
disordered imagination. His notions are like plaster figures cast in
a mould, as brittle as they are hollow; but they will break before
you can make them give way. In fact, he is the representative of
a large part of the community, the shallow, the vain, and indolent,
of those who have time to talk, and are not bound to think: and he
considers any deviation from the select forms of common-place, or
the accredited language of conventional impertinence, as compromising
the authority under which he acts in his diplomatic capacity. It
is wonderful how this class of people agree with one another; how
they herd together in all their opinions; what a tact they have for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>folly; what an instinct for absurdity; what a sympathy in sentiment;
how they find one another out by infallible signs, like Freemasons!
The secret of this unanimity and strict accord is, that not any one
of them ever admits any opinion that can cost the least effort of mind
in arriving at, or of courage in declaring it. Folly is as consistent
with itself as wisdom: there is a certain level of thought and sentiment,
which the weakest minds, as well as the strongest, find out as best
adapted to them; and you as regularly come to the same conclusions,
by looking no farther than the surface, as if you dug to the centre of
the earth! You know beforehand what a critic of this class will say
on almost every subject the first time he sees you, the next time, the
time after that, and so on to the end of the chapter. The following
list of his opinions may be relied on:—It is pretty certain that before
you have been in the room with him ten minutes, he will give you to
understand that Shakspeare was a great but irregular genius. Again,
he thinks it a question whether any one of his plays, if brought out
now for the first time, would succeed. He thinks that <cite>Macbeth</cite>
would be the most likely, from the music which has been since introduced
into it. He has some doubts as to the superiority of the
French School over us in tragedy, and observes, that Hume and Adam
Smith were both of that opinion. He thinks Milton’s pedantry a
great blemish in his writings, and that <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> has many prosaic
passages in it. He conceives that genius does not always imply taste,
and that wit and judgment are very different faculties. He considers
Dr. Johnson as a great critic and moralist, and that his Dictionary was
a work of prodigious erudition and vast industry; but that some of the
anecdotes of him in Boswell are trifling. He conceives that Mr.
Locke was a very original and profound thinker. He thinks Gibbon’s
style vigorous but florid. He wonders that the author of <em>Junius</em> was
never found out. He thinks Pope’s translation of the <cite>Iliad</cite> an improvement
on the simplicity of the original, which was necessary to
fit it to the taste of modern readers. He thinks there is a great deal
of grossness in the old comedies; and that there has been a great
improvement in the morals of the higher classes since the reign of
Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> He thinks the reign of Queen Anne the golden period
of our literature, but that, upon the whole, we have no English writer
equal to Voltaire. He speaks of Boccacio as a very licentious
writer, and thinks the wit in Rabelais quite extravagant, though he
never read either of them. He cannot get through Spenser’s <cite>Fairy
Queen</cite>, and pronounces all allegorical poetry tedious. He prefers
Smollett to Fielding, and discovers more knowledge of the world
in <cite>Gil Blas</cite> than in <cite>Don Quixote</cite>. Richardson he thinks very minute
and tedious. He thinks the French Revolution has done a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>deal of harm to the cause of liberty; and blames Buonaparte for
being so ambitious. He reads the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> and <cite>Quarterly Reviews</cite>,
and thinks as they do. He is shy of having an opinion on a new
actor or a new singer; for the public do not always agree with the
newspapers. He thinks that the moderns have great advantages over
the ancients in many respects. He thinks Jeremy Bentham a greater
man than Aristotle. He can see no reason why artists of the present
day should not paint as well as Raphael or Titian. For instance, he
thinks there is something very elegant and classical in Mr. Westall’s
drawings. He has no doubt that Sir Joshua Reynolds’s Lectures
were written by Burke. He considers Horne Tooke’s account of
the conjunction <em>That</em> very ingenious, and holds that no writer can be
called elegant who uses the present for the subjunctive mood, who
says <em>If it is</em> for <em>If it be</em>. He thinks Hogarth a great master of low,
comic humour; and Cobbett a coarse, vulgar writer. He often talks
of men of liberal education, and men without education, as if that
made much difference. He judges of people by their pretensions;
and pays attention to their opinions according to their dress and rank
in life. If he meets with a fool, he does not find him out; and if he
meets with any one wiser than himself, he does not know what to
make of him. He thinks that manners are of great consequence to
the common intercourse of life. He thinks it difficult to prove the
existence of any such thing as original genius, or to fix a general
standard of taste. He does not think it possible to define what wit
is. In religion, his opinions are liberal. He considers all enthusiasm
as a degree of madness, particularly to be guarded against by young
minds; and believes that truth lies in the middle, between the extremes
of right and wrong. He thinks that the object of poetry is
to please; and that astronomy is a very pleasing and useful study.
He thinks all this, and a great deal more, that amounts to nothing.

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 35.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON THE CATALOGUE RAISONNÉ OF THE BRITISH INSTITUTION&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Nov. 10, 1816.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span> of the pictures lately exhibited at the British
Institution is worthy of notice, both as it is understood to be a declaration
of the views of the Royal Academy, and as it contains some
erroneous notions with respect to art prevalent in this country. It
sets out with the following passages:—</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The first resolution ever framed by the noblemen and gentlemen
who met to establish the British Institution, consists of the following
sentence, viz.:</p>

<p class='c000'>‘“The <em>object</em> of the establishment is to facilitate, by a Public
Exhibition, the <em>Sale</em> of the productions of <em>British</em> artists.”</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Now, if the Directors had not felt quite certain as to the result
of the present Exhibition, (of the Flemish School), if they had not
perfectly satisfied themselves, that, instead of affording any, even the
least means of promoting <em>unfair and invidious comparisons, it would
produce abundant matter for exaltation to the living Artist</em>, can we
possibly imagine they, the foster-parents of British Art, would ever
have suffered such a display to have taken place? Certainly not.
If they had not foreseen and fully provided against <em>all such injurious
results</em>, by the deep and masterly manœuvre alluded to in our former
remarks, is it conceivable that the Directors would have acted in a
way so counter, so diametrically in opposition to this their fundamental
and leading principle? No, No! It is a position which all
sense of respect for their consistency will not suffer us to admit,
which all feelings of respect for their views forbid us to allow.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Is it at all to be wondered at, that, in an Exhibition such as this,
where nothing <em>like a patriotic desire</em> to uphold the arts of their country
can possibly have place in the minds of the Directors, we should
attribute to them the desire of <em>holding up the old Masters to derision</em>,
inasmuch as good policy would allow? Is it to be wondered at, that,
when the Directors have the three-fold prospect, by so doing, of
estranging the silly and ignorant Collector from his false and senseless
infatuation for the <em>Black Masters</em>, of turning his <em>unjust preference</em> from
Foreign to British Art, and, by affording the living painters a just
encouragement, teach them to feel that becoming confidence in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>powers, which an acknowledgment of their merits entitles them to?
Is it to be wondered at, we say, that a little duplicity should have
been practised upon this occasion, that some of our ill-advised
Collectors and second-rate picture Amateurs should have been singled
out as sheep for the sacrifice, and <em>thus ingeniously</em> made to pay unwilling
homage <em>to the talents of their countrymen</em>, through that very
medium by which they had previously been induced <em>to depreciate
them</em>?’—‘If, in our wish to please the Directors, we should, without
mercy, damn all that deserves damning, and effectually hide our
admiration for those pieces and passages which are truly entitled to
admiration, it must be placed entirely to that <em>patriotic sympathy</em>, which
we feel in common with the Directors, of holding up to the public,
as the first and great object, <span class='fss'>THE PATRONAGE OF MODERN ART</span>.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Once more:</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Who does not perceive (except those whose eyes are not made
for seeing more than they are told by others) that Vandyke’s portraits,
by the brilliant colour of the velvet hangings, are made to look as if
they had been newly fetched home from the clear-starcher, with a
double portion of blue in their ruffs? Who does not see, that the
angelic females in Rubens’s pictures (particularly in that of the
Brazen Serpent) labour under a fit of the bile, twice as severe as they
would do, if they were not suffering on red velvet? Who does not
see, from the same cause, that the landscapes by the same Master are
converted into <em>brown studies</em>, and that Rembrandt’s ladies and gentlemen
of fashion look as if they had been on duty for the whole of last
week in the Prince Regent’s new sewer? <em>And who, that has any
penetration, that has any gratitude, does not see, in seeing all this, the
anxious and benevolent solicitude of the Directors to keep the old masters
under?</em>’</p>

<p class='c000'>So, then, this Writer would think it a matter of lively gratitude,
and of exultation in the breasts of living Artists, if the Directors, ‘in
their anxious and benevolent desire to keep the old Masters under,’
had contrived to make Vandyke’s pictures look like starch and blue:
if they had converted Rubens’s pictures into brown studies, or a fit
of the bile; or had dragged Rembrandt’s through the Prince Regent’s
new sewers. It would have been a great gain, a great triumph to the
Academy and to the Art, to have nothing left of all the pleasure or
admiration which those painters had hitherto imparted to the world,
to find all the excellences which their works had been supposed to
possess, and all respect for them in the minds of the public destroyed,
and converted into sudden loathing and disgust. This is, according
to the Catalogue-writer and his friends, a consummation devoutly to
be wished for themselves and for the Art. All that is taken from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the old Masters is so much added to the moderns; the marring of Art
is the making of the Academy. This is the kind of patronage and
promotion of the Fine Arts on which he insists as necessary to keep
up the reputation of living Artists, and to ensure the sale of their
works. There is nothing then in common between the merits of the
old Masters and the doubtful claims of the new: <em>those</em> are not ‘the
scale by which we can ascend to the love’ of these. The excellences
of the latter are of their own making and of their own seeing; we
must take their own word for them; and not only so, but we must
sacrifice all established principles and all established reputation to
their upstart pretensions, because, if the old pictures are not totally
worthless, their own can be good for nothing. The only chance,
therefore, for the moderns, if the Catalogue-writer is to be believed,
is to decry all the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></span></i> of the Art, and to hold up all the
great names in it to derision. If the public once get to relish the
style of the old Masters, they will no longer tolerate theirs. But so
long as the old Masters can be <em>kept under</em>, the coloured caricatures of
the moderns, like <em>Mrs. Peachum’s</em> coloured handkerchiefs, ‘will be
of sure sale at their warehouse at Redriff.’ The Catalogue-writer
thinks it necessary, in order to raise the Art in this country, to
depreciate all Art in all other times and countries. He thinks that
the way to excite an enthusiastic admiration of genius in the public
is by setting the example of a vulgar and malignant hatred of it in
himself. He thinks to inspire a lofty spirit of emulation in the rising
generation, by shutting his eyes to the excellences of all the finest
models, or by pouring out upon them the overflowings of his gall and
envy, to disfigure them in the eyes of others; so that they may see
nothing in Raphael, in Titian, in Rubens, in Rembrandt, in Vandyke,
in Claude Lorraine, in Leonardo da Vinci, but the low wit and dirty
imagination of a paltry scribbler; and come away from the greatest
monuments of human capacity, without one feeling of excellence in
art, or of beauty or grandeur in nature. Nay, he would persuade us
that this is a great public and private benefit, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>, that there is no
such thing as excellence, as genius, as true fame, except what he and
his anonymous associates arrogate to themselves, with all the profit
and credit of this degradation of genius, this ruin of Art, this obloquy
and contempt heaped on great and unrivalled reputation. He thinks
it a likely mode of producing confidence in the existence and value
of Art, to prove that there never was any such thing, till the last annual
Exhibition of the Royal Academy. He would encourage a disinterested
love of Art, and a liberal patronage of it in the great and
opulent, by shewing that the living Artists have no regard, but the most
sovereign and reckless contempt for it, except as it can be made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>temporary stalking-horse to their pride and avarice. The writer may
have a <em>patriotic sympathy</em> with the sale of modern works of Art, but
we do not see what sympathy there can be between the buyers and
sellers of these works, except in the love of the Art itself. When
we find that these patriotic persons would destroy the Art itself to
promote the sale of their pictures, we know what to say to them.
We are obliged to the zeal of our critic for having set this matter in
so clear a light. The public will feel little sympathy with a body of
Artists who disclaim all sympathy with all other Artists. They will
doubt their pretensions to genius who have no feeling of respect for
it in others; they will consider them as bastards, not children of the
Art, who would destroy their parent. The public will hardly consent,
when the proposition is put to them in this tangible shape, to give up
the cause of liberal art and of every liberal sentiment connected with
it, and enter, with their eyes open, into a pettifogging cabal to keep
the old Masters under, or hold their names up to derision ‘as good
sport,’ merely to gratify the selfish importunity of a gang of sturdy
beggars, who demand public encouragement and support, with a claim
of settlement in one hand, and a forged certificate of merit in the other.
They can only deserve well of the public by deserving well of the
Art. Have we taken these men from the plough, from the counter,
from the shop-board, from the tap-room and the stable-door, to raise
them to fortune, to rank, and distinction in life, for the sake of Art,
to give them a chance of doing something in Art like what had been
done before them, of promoting and refining the public taste, of
setting before them the great models of Art, and by a pure love of
truth and beauty, and by patient and disinterested aspirations after it,
of rising to the highest excellence, and of making themselves ‘a name
great above all names’; and do they now turn round upon us, and
because they have neglected these high objects of their true calling
for pitiful cabals and filling their pockets, insist that we shall league
with them in crushing the progress of Art, and the respect attached to
all its great efforts? There is no other country in the world in which
such a piece of impudent quackery could be put forward with impunity,
and still less in which it could be put forward in the garb of
patriotism. This is the effect of our gross island manners. The
Catalogue-writer carries his bear-garden notions of this virtue into the
Fine Arts, and would set about destroying Dutch or Italian pictures as
he would Dutch shipping or Italian liberty. He goes up to the
Rembrandts with the same swaggering Jack-tar airs as he would to
a battery of nine-pounders, and snaps his fingers at Raphael as he
would at the French. Yet he talks big about the Elgin Marbles,
because Mr. Payne Knight has made a slip on that subject; though,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>to be consistent, he ought to be for pounding them in a mortar, should
get his friend the Incendiary to set fire to the room building for them
at the British Museum, or should get Mr. Soane to build it. Patriotism
and the Fine Arts have nothing to do with one another—because
patriotism relates to exclusive advantages, and the advantages of the
Fine Arts are not exclusive, but communicable. The physical property
of one country cannot be shared without loss by another: the physical
force of one country may destroy that of another. These, therefore,
are objects of national jealousy and fear of encroachment: for the
interests or rights of different countries may be compromised in them.
But it is not so in the Fine Arts, which depend upon taste and knowledge.
We do not consume the works of Art as articles of food, of
clothing, or fuel; but we brood over their <em>idea</em>, which is accessible
to all, and may be multiplied without end, ‘with riches fineless.’
Patriotism is ‘beastly; subtle as the fox for prey; like warlike as
the wolf for what it eats’; but Art is ideal, and therefore liberal.
The knowledge or perfection of Art in one age or country is the
cause of its existence or perfection in another. Art is the cause of
art in other men. Works of genius done by a Dutchman are the
cause of genius in an Englishman—are the cause of taste in an
Englishman. The patronage of foreign Art is, not to prevent, but
to promote Art in England. It does not prevent, but promote taste
in England. Art subsists by communication, not by exclusion. The
light of art, like that of nature, shines on all alike; and its benefit,
like that of the sun, is in being seen and felt. The spirit of art is
not the spirit of trade: it is not a question between the grower or
consumer of some perishable and personal commodity: but it is a
question between human genius and human taste, how much the one
can produce for the benefit of mankind, and how much the other can
enjoy. It is ‘the link of peaceful commerce ‘twixt dividable shores.’
To take from it this character is to take from it its best privilege, its
humanity. Would any one, except our Catalogue-virtuoso, think of
destroying or concealing the monuments of Art in past ages, as inconsistent
with the progress of taste and civilisation in the present?
Would any one find fault with the introduction of the works of
Raphael into this country, as if their being done by an Italian confined
the benefit to a foreign country, when all the benefit, all the
great and lasting benefit, (except the purchase-money, the lasting
burden of the Catalogue, and the great test of the value of Art in
the opinion of the writer), is instantly communicated to all eyes
that behold, and all hearts that can feel them? It is many years ago
since we first saw the prints of the Cartoons hung round the parlour
of a little inn on the great north road. We were then very young,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>and had not been initiated into the principles of taste and refinement
of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite>. We had heard of the fame of the
Cartoons, but this was the first time that we had ever been admitted
face to face into the presence of those divine works. ‘How were
we then uplifted!’ Prophets and Apostles stood before us, and the
Saviour of the Christian world, with his attributes of faith and
power; miracles were working on the walls; the hand of Raphael
was there, and as his pencil traced the lines, we saw god-like spirits
and lofty shapes descend and walk visibly the earth, but as if their
thoughts still lifted them above the earth. There was that figure
of St. Paul, pointing with noble fervour to ‘temples not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens,’ and that finer one of Christ in the
boat, whose whole figure seems sustained by meekness and love, and
that of the same person, surrounded by the disciples, like a flock of
sheep listening to the music of some divine shepherd. We knew
not how enough to admire them. If from this transport and
delight there arose in our breasts a wish, a deep aspiration of mingled
hope and fear, to be able one day to do something like them, that
hope has long since vanished; but not with it the love of Art, nor
delight in works of Art, nor admiration of the genius which produces
them, nor respect for fame which rewards and crowns them! Did
we suspect that in this feeling of enthusiasm for the works of Raphael
we were deficient in patriotic sympathy, or that, in spreading it as
far as we could, we did an injury to our country or to living Art?
The very feeling shewed that there was no such distinction in Art,
that her benefits were common, that the power of genius, like the
spirit of the world, is everywhere alike present. And would the
harpies of criticism try to extinguish this common benefit to their
country from a pretended exclusive attachment to their countrymen?
Would they rob their country of Raphael to set up the credit of their
professional little-goes and E. O. tables—‘cutpurses of the Art, that
from the shelf the precious diadem stole, and put it in their pockets’?
Tired of exposing such folly, we walked out the other day, and saw
a bright cloud resting on the bosom of the blue expanse, which
reminded us of what we had seen in some picture in the Louvre.
We were suddenly roused from our reverie, by recollecting that till
we had answered this catchpenny publication we had no right, without
being liable to a charge of disaffection to our country or treachery
to the Art, to look at nature, or to think of any thing like it in Art, not
of British growth and manufacture!</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The Catalogue-writer nicknames the Flemish painters ‘the Black
Masters.’ Either this means that the works of Rubens and Vandyke
were originally black pictures, that is, deeply shadowed like those
of Rembrandt, which is false, there being no painter who used so
little shadow as Vandyke, or so much colour as Rubens; or it must
mean that their pictures have turned darker with time, that is, that
the art itself is a black art. Is this a triumph for the Academy?
Is the defect and decay of Art a subject of exultation to the national
genius? Then there is no hope (in this country at least) ‘that a
great man’s memory may outlive him half a year!’ Do they calculate
that the decomposition and gradual disappearance of the standard
works of Art will quicken the demand, and facilitate the sale of modern
pictures? Have they no hope of immortality themselves, that they
are glad to see the inevitable dissolution of all that has long flourished
in splendour and in honour? They are pleased to find, that at the
end of near two hundred years, the pictures of Vandyke and Rubens
have suffered half as much from time as those of their late President
have done in thirty or forty, or their own in the last ten or twelve
years. So that the glory of painting is that it does not last for ever:
it is this which puts the ancients and the moderns on a level. They
hail with undisguised satisfaction the approaches of the slow mouldering
hand of time in those works which have lasted longest, not
anticipating the premature fate of their own. Such is their short-sighted
ambition. A picture is with them like the frame it is in,
<em>as good as new</em>; and the best picture, that which was last painted.
They make the weak side of Art the test of its excellence; and
though a modern picture of two years standing is hardly fit to be
seen, from the general ignorance of the painter in the mechanical as
well as other parts of the Art, yet they are sure at any time to get
the start of Rubens or Vandyke, by painting a picture against the day
of exhibition. We even question whether they would wish to make
their own pictures last if they could, and whether they would not
destroy their own works as well as those of others, (like chalk figures
on the floors), to have new ones bespoke the next day. The Flemish
pictures then, except those of Rembrandt, were not originally black;
they have not faded in proportion to the length of time they have
been painted. All that comes then of the nickname in the Catalogue is,
that the pictures of the old Masters have lasted longer than those of the
present members of the Royal Academy, and that the latter, it is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>presumed, do not wish their works to last so long, lest they should be
called the <em>Black Masters</em>. With respect to Rembrandt, this epitaph
may be literally true. But, we would ask, whether the style of
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</span></i>, in which Rembrandt painted, is not one fine view of nature
and of art? Whether any other painter carried it to the same height
of perfection as he did? Whether any other painter ever joined the
same depth of shadow with the same clearness? Whether his tones
were not as fine as they were true? Whether a more thorough master
of his art ever lived? Whether he deserved for this to be nicknamed
by the Writer of the Catalogue, or to have his works ‘kept under, or
himself held up to derision,’ by the Patrons and Directors of the
British Institution for the support and encouragement of the Fine Arts?</p>

<p class='c000'>But we have heard it said by a disciple and commentator on the
Catalogue, (one would think it was hardly possible to descend lower
than the writer himself), that the Directors of the British Institution
assume a consequence to themselves, hostile to the pretensions of
modern professors, out of the reputation of the old Masters, whom
they affect to look upon with wonder, to worship as something preternatural;—that
they consider the bare possession of an old picture as
a title to distinction, and the respect paid to Art as the highest pretension
of the owner. And is this then a subject of complaint with
the Academy, that genius is thus thought of, when its claims are once
fully established? That those high qualities, which are beyond the
estimate of ignorance and selfishness while living, receive their reward
from distant ages? Do they not ‘feel the future in the instant’?
Do they not know, that those qualities which appeal neither to interest
nor passion can only find their level with time, and would they
annihilate the only pretensions they have? Or have they no conscious
affinity with true genius, no claim to the reversion of true fame, no
right of succession to this lasting inheritance and final reward of great
exertions, which they would therefore destroy, to prevent others from
enjoying it? Does all their ambition begin and end in their <em>patriotic
sympathy</em> with the sale of modern works of Art, and have they no
fellow-feeling with the hopes and final destiny of human genius?
What poet ever complained of the respect paid to Homer as derogatory
to himself? The envy and opposition to established fame is
peculiar to the race of modern Artists; and it is to be hoped it will
remain so. It is the fault of their education. It is only by a liberal
education that we learn to feel respect for the past, or to take an
interest in the future. The knowledge of Artists is too often confined
to their art, and their views to their own interest. Even in this they
are wrong:—in all respects they are wrong. As a mere matter of
trade, the prejudice in favour of old pictures does not prevent but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>assist the sale of modern works of Art. If there was not a prejudice
in favour of old pictures, there could be a prejudice in favour of none,
and none would be sold. The professors seem to think, that for
every old picture not sold, one of their own would be. This is a false
calculation. The contrary is true. For every old picture not sold,
one of their own (in proportion) would <em>not</em> be sold. The practice of
buying pictures is a habit, and it must begin with those pictures which
have a character and name, and not with those which have none.
‘Depend upon it,’ says Mr. Burke in a letter to Barry, ‘whatever
attracts public attention to the Arts, will in the end be for the benefit of
the Artists themselves.’ Again, do not the Academicians know, that
it is a contradiction in terms, that a man should enjoy the advantages
of posthumous fame in his lifetime? Most men cease to be of any
consequence at all when they are dead; but it is the privilege of the
man of genius to survive himself. But he cannot in the nature of
things anticipate this privilege—because in all that appeals to the
general intellect of mankind, this appeal is strengthened, as it spreads
wider and is acknowledged; because a man cannot unite in himself
personally the suffrages of distant ages and nations; because popularity,
a newspaper puff, cannot have the certainty of lasting fame; because
it does not carry the same weight of sympathy with it; because it
cannot have the same interest, the same refinement or grandeur. If
Mr. West was equal to Raphael, (which he is not), if Mr. Lawrence
was equal to Vandyke or Titian, (which he is not), if Mr. Turner
was equal to Claude Lorraine, (which he is not), if Mr. Wilkie was
equal to Teniers, (which he is not), yet they could not, nor ought
they to be thought of in the same manner, because there could not be
the same proof of it, nor the same confidence in the opinion of a man
and his friends, or of any one generation, as in that of successive
generations and the voice of posterity. If it is said that we pass over
the faults of the one, and severely scrutinise the excellences of the
other; this is also right and necessary, because the one have passed
their trial, and the others are upon it. If we forgive or overlook
the faults of the ancients, it is because they have dearly earned it at
our hands. We ought to have some objects to indulge our enthusiasm
upon; and we ought to indulge it upon the highest, and those that are
surest of deserving it. Would one of our Academicians expect us to
look at his new house in one of the new squares with the same
veneration as at Michael Angelo’s, which he built with his own hands,
as at Tully’s villa, or at the tomb of Virgil? We have no doubt
they would, but we cannot. Besides, if it were possible to transfer
our old prejudices to new candidates, the way to effect this is not by
destroying them. If we have no confidence in all that has gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>before us, in what has received the sanction of time and the concurring
testimony of disinterested judges, are we to believe all of a sudden
that excellence has started up in our own times, because it never
existed before: are we to take the Artists’ own word for their
superiority to their predecessors? There is one other plea made by
the moderns, ‘that they must live,’ and the answer to it is, that
they do live. An Academician makes his thousand a-year by portrait-painting,
and complains that the encouragement given to foreign Art
deprives him of the means of subsistence, and prevents him from
indulging his genius in works of high history,—‘playing at will his
virgin fancies wild.’</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the comparative merits of the ancients and the moderns, it
does not admit of a question. The odds are too much in favour of
the former, because it is likely that more good pictures were painted
in the last three hundred than in the last thirty years. Now, the old
pictures are the best remaining out of all that period, setting aside
those of living Artists. If they are bad, the Art itself is good for
nothing; for they are the best that ever were. They are not good,
because they are old; but they have become old, because they are
good. The question is not between this and any other generation,
but between the present and all preceding generations, whom the
Catalogue-writer, in his misguided zeal, undertakes to vilify and ‘to
keep under, or hold up to derision.’ To say that the great names
which have come down to us are not worth any thing, is to say that
the mountain-tops which we see in the farthest horizon are not so high
as the intervening objects. If there had been any greater painters
than Vandyke or Rubens, or Raphael or Rembrandt, or N. Poussin
or Claude Lorraine, we should have heard of them, we should have
seen them in the Gallery, and we should have read a patriotic and
disinterested account of them in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite>. Waiving
the unfair and invidious comparison between all former excellence
and the concentrated essence of it in the present age, let us ask who,
in the last generation of painters, was equal to the old masters? Was
it Highmore, or Hayman, or Hudson, or Kneller? Who was the
English Raphael, or Rubens, or Vandyke, of that day, to whom the
Catalogue-critic would have extended his patriotic sympathy and
damning patronage? Kneller, we have been told, was thought
superior to Vandyke by the persons of fashion whom he painted. So
St. Thomas Apostle seems higher than St. Paul’s while you are close
under it; but the farther off you go the higher the mighty dome
aspires into the skies. What is become of all those great men who
flourished in our own time—‘like flowers in men’s caps, dying or ere
they sicken’—Hoppner, Opie, Shee, Loutherbourg, Rigaud, Romney,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Barry, the painters of the Shakspeare Gallery? ‘Gone to the vault
of all the Capulets,’ and their pictures with them, or before them!
Shall we put more faith in their successors? Shall we take the words
of their friends for their taste and genius? No, we will stick to what
we know will stick to us, the ‘heirlooms’ of the Art, the Black
Masters. The picture, for instance, of Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> on horseback, which
our critic criticises with such heavy drollery, is worth all the pictures
that were ever exhibited at the Royal Academy (from the time of
Sir Joshua to the present time inclusive) put together. It shews
more knowledge and feeling of the Art, more skill and beauty, more
sense of what it is in objects that gives pleasure to the eye, with more
power to communicate this pleasure to the world. If either this
single picture, or all the lumber that has ever appeared at the Academy,
were to be destroyed, there could not be a question which, with any
Artist or with any judge or lover of Art. So stands the account
between ancient and modern Art! By this we may judge of all the
rest. The Catalogue-writer makes some strictures in the second part
on the Waterloo Exhibition, which he does not think what it ought
to be. We wonder he had another word to say on modern Art after
seeing it. He should instantly have taken the resolution of <em>Iago</em>,
‘From this time forth I never will speak more.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite> has fallen foul of two things
which ought to be sacred to Artists and lovers of Art—Genius and
Fame. If they are not sacred to them, we do not know to whom
they will be sacred. A work such as the present shews that the
person who could write it must either have no knowledge or taste
for Art, or must be actuated by a feeling of unaccountable malignity
towards it. It shews that any body of men by whom it could be
set on foot or encouraged are not an Academy of Art. It shews that
a country in which such a publication could make its appearance is
not the country of the Fine Arts. Does the writer think to prove the
genius of his countrymen for Art by proclaiming their utter insensibility
and flagitious contempt for all beauty and excellence in the art,
except in their own works? No! it is very true that the English
are a shopkeeping nation; and the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite> is the proof
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, the works of the moderns are not, like those of the Old
Masters, a second nature. Oh Art, true likeness of nature, ‘balm of
hurt minds, great nature’s second course, chief nourisher in life’s
feast,’ of what would our Catalogue-mongers deprive us in depriving
us of thee and of thy glories, of the lasting works of the great Painters,
and of their names no less magnificent, grateful to our hearts as
the sound of celestial harmony from other spheres, waking around us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>(whether heard or not) from youth to age, the stay, the guide and
anchor of our purest thoughts; whom, having once seen, we always
remember, and who teach us to see all things through them; without
whom life would be to begin again, and the earth barren; of Raphael,
who lifted the human form half way to heaven; of Titian, who
painted the mind in the face, and unfolded the soul of things to the
eye; of Rubens, around whose pencil gorgeous shapes thronged
numberless, startling us by the novel accidents of form and colour,
putting the spirit of motion into the universe, and weaving a gay
fantastic round and Bacchanalian dance with nature; of thee, too,
Rembrandt, who didst redeem one half of nature from obloquy, from
the nickname in the Catalogue, ‘smoothing the raven down of darkness
till it smiled,’ and tinging it with a light like streaks of burnished
ore; of these, and more, of whom the world is scarce worthy; and
what would they give us in return? Nothing.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 37.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON POETICAL VERSATILITY&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Dec. 22, 1816.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The spirit of poetry is in itself favourable to humanity and liberty:
but, we suspect, not when its aid is most wanted. The spirit of
poetry is not the spirit of mortification or of martyrdom. Poetry
dwells in a perpetual Utopia of its own, and is for that reason very
ill calculated to make a Paradise upon earth, by encountering the
shocks and disappointments of the world. Poetry, like law, is a
fiction, only a more agreeable one. It does not create difficulties
where they do not exist; but contrives to get rid of them, whether
they exist or not. It is not entangled in cobwebs of its own making,
but soars above all obstacles. It cannot be ‘constrained by mastery.’
It has the range of the universe; it traverses the empyrean, and looks
down on nature from a higher sphere. When it lights upon the
earth, it loses some of its dignity and its use. Its strength is in its
wings; its element the air. Standing on its feet, jostling with the
crowd, it is liable to be overthrown, trampled on, and defaced; for
its wings are of a dazzling brightness, ‘heaven’s own tinct,’ and the
least soil upon them shews to disadvantage. Sullied, degraded as
we have seen it, we shall not insult over it, but leave it to Time to
take out the stains, seeing it is a thing immortal as itself. ‘Being
so majestical, we should do it wrong to offer it the show of violence.’
But the best things, in their abuse, often become the worst; and so
it is with poetry when it is diverted from its proper end. Poets live
in an ideal world, where they make everything out according to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>wishes and fancies. They either find things delightful or make them
so. They feign the beautiful and grand out of their own minds, and
imagine all things to be, not what they are, but what they ought to
be. They are naturally inventors, creators of truth, of love, and
beauty: and while they speak to us from the sacred shrine of their
own hearts, while they pour out the pure treasures of thought to the
world, they cannot be too much admired and applauded: but when,
forgetting their high calling, and becoming tools and puppets in the
hands of power, they would pass off the gewgaws of corruption and
love-tokens of self-interest as the gifts of the Muse, they cannot be
too much despised and shunned. We do not like novels founded on
facts, nor do we like poets turned courtiers. Poets, it has been said,
succeed best in fiction: and they should for the most part stick to it.
Invention, not upon an imaginary subject, is a lie: the varnishing
over the vices or deformities of actual objects is hypocrisy. Players
leave their finery at the stage-door, or they would be hooted; poets
come out into the world with all their bravery on, and yet they
would pass for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i> persons. They lend the colours of fancy to
whatever they see: whatever they touch becomes gold, though it
were lead. With them every Joan is a lady; and kings and queens
are human. Matters of fact they embellish at their will, and reason
is the plaything of their passions, their caprice, or their interest.
There is no practice so base of which they will not become the
panders: no sophistry of which their understanding may not be made
the voluntary dupe. Their only object is to please their fancy.
Their souls are effeminate, half man and half woman:—they want
fortitude, and are without principle. If things do not turn out according
to their wishes, they will make their wishes turn round to things.
They can easily overlook whatever they do not like, and make an
idol of any thing they please. The object of poetry is to please: this
art naturally gives pleasure, and excites admiration. Poets, therefore,
cannot do well without sympathy and flattery. It is accordingly
very much against the grain that they remain long on the unpopular
side of the question. They do not like to be shut out when laurels
are to be given away at Court—or places under Government to be
disposed of, in romantic situations in the country. They are happy
to be reconciled on the first opportunity to prince and people, and to
exchange their principles for a pension. They have not always
strength of mind to think for themselves, nor courage enough to bear
the unjust stigma of the opinions they have taken upon trust from
others. Truth alone does not satisfy their pampered appetites without
the sauce of praise. To prefer truth to all other things, it
requires that the mind should have been at some pains in finding it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>out, and that we should feel a severe delight in the contemplation of
truth, seen by its own clear light, and not as it is reflected in the
admiring eyes of the world. A philosopher may perhaps make a
shift to be contented with the sober draughts of reason: a poet must
have the applause of the world to intoxicate him. Milton was,
however, a poet, and an honest man; he was Cromwell’s secretary.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 38.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON ACTORS AND ACTING&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Jan. 5, 1817.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Players are ‘the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time’; the
motley representatives of human nature. They are the only honest
hypocrites. Their life is a voluntary dream; a studied madness.
The height of their ambition is to be <em>beside themselves</em>. To-day kings,
to-morrow beggars, it is only when they are themselves, that they are
nothing. Made up of mimic laughter and tears, passing from the
extremes of joy or woe at the prompter’s call, they wear the livery
of other men’s fortunes; their very thoughts are not their own.
They are, as it were, train-bearers in the pageant of life, and hold a
glass up to humanity, frailer than itself. We see ourselves at second-hand
in them: they shew us all that we are, all that we wish to be,
and all that we dread to be. The stage is an epitome, a bettered
likeness of the world, with the dull part left out: and, indeed, with
this omission, it is nearly big enough to hold all the rest. What
brings the resemblance nearer is, that, as <em>they</em> imitate us, we, in our
turn, imitate them. How many fine gentlemen do we owe to the
stage? How many romantic lovers are mere Romeos in masquerade?
How many soft bosoms have heaved with Juliet’s sighs? They
teach us when to laugh and when to weep, when to love and when to
hate, upon principle and with a good grace! Wherever there is a
play-house, the world will go on not amiss. The stage not only
refines the manners, but it is the best teacher of morals, for it is the
truest and most intelligible picture of life. It stamps the image of
virtue on the mind by first softening the rude materials of which it is
composed, by a sense of pleasure. It regulates the passions by giving
a loose to the imagination. It points out the selfish and depraved to
our detestation, the amiable and generous to our admiration; and if
it clothes the more seductive vices with the borrowed graces of wit
and fancy, even those graces operate as a diversion to the coarser
poison of experience and bad example, and often prevent or carry off
the infection by inoculating the mind with a certain taste and elegance.
To shew how little we agree with the common declamations against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the immoral tendency of the stage on this score, we will hazard a
conjecture, that the acting of the Beggar’s Opera a certain number of
nights every year since it was first brought out, has done more towards
putting down the practice of highway robbery, than all the gibbets that
ever were erected. A person, after seeing this piece is too deeply
imbued with a sense of humanity, is in too good humour with himself
and the rest of the world, to set about cutting throats or rifling
pockets. Whatever makes a jest of vice, leaves it too much a matter
of indifference for any one in his senses to rush desperately on his
ruin for its sake. We suspect that just the contrary effect must be
produced by the representation of George Barnwell, which is too
much in the style of the Ordinary’s sermon to meet with any better
success. The mind, in such cases, instead of being deterred by the
alarming consequences held out to it, revolts against the denunciation
of them as an insult offered to its free-will, and, in a spirit of defiance,
returns a practical answer to them, by daring the worst that can
happen. The most striking lesson ever read to levity and licentiousness,
is in the last act of the Inconstant, where young Mirabel is
preserved by the fidelity of his mistress, Orinda, in the disguise of a
page, from the hands of assassins, into whose power he has been
allured by the temptations of vice and beauty. There never was a
rake who did not become in imagination a reformed man, during the
representation of the last trying scenes of this admirable comedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the stage is useful as a school of instruction, it is no less so as
a source of amusement. It is the source of the greatest enjoyment at
the time, and a never-failing fund of agreeable reflection afterwards.
The merits of a new play, or of a new actor, are always among the
first topics of polite conversation. One way in which public exhibitions
contribute to refine and humanise mankind, is by supplying them
with ideas and subjects of conversation and interest in common. The
progress of civilisation is in proportion to the number of common-places
current in society. For instance, if we meet with a stranger
at an inn or in a stage-coach, who knows nothing but his own affairs,
his shop, his customers, his farm, his pigs, his poultry, we can carry
on no conversation with him on these local and personal matters: the
only way is to let him have all the talk to himself. But if he has
fortunately ever seen Mr. Liston act, this is an immediate topic of
mutual conversation, and we agree together the rest of the evening in
discussing the merits of that inimitable actor, with the same satisfaction
as in talking over the affairs of the most intimate friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the stage thus introduces us familiarly to our contemporaries, it
also brings us acquainted with former times. It is an interesting
revival of past ages, manners, opinions, dresses, persons, and actions,—whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>it carries us back to the wars of York and Lancaster, or
half way back to the heroic times of Greece and Rome, in some
translation from the French, or quite back to the age of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>
in the scenes of Congreve and of Etherege, (the gay Sir George!)—happy
age, when kings and nobles led purely ornamental lives; when
the utmost stretch of a morning’s study went no further than the
choice of a sword-knot, or the adjustment of a side-curl; when the
soul spoke out in all the pleasing eloquence of dress; and beaux and
belles, enamoured of themselves in one another’s follies, fluttered like
gilded butterflies in giddy mazes through the walks of St. James’s
Park!</p>

<p class='c000'>A good company of comedians, a Theatre-Royal judiciously managed,
is your true Herald’s College; the only Antiquarian Society, that is
worth a rush. It is for this reason that there is such an air of
romance about players, and that it is pleasanter to see them, even in
their own persons, than any of the three learned professions. We
feel more respect for John Kemble in a plain coat, than for the Lord
Chancellor on the woolsack. He is surrounded, to our eyes, with
a greater number of imposing recollections: he is a more reverend
piece of formality; a more complicated tissue of costume. We do
not know whether to look upon this accomplished actor as Pierre or
King John or Coriolanus or Cato or Leontes or the Stranger. But
we see in him a stately hieroglyphic of humanity; a living monument
of departed greatness, a sombre comment on the rise and fall of
kings. We look after him till he is out of sight, as we listen to a
story of one of Ossian’s heroes, to ‘a tale of other times!’</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most affecting things we know is to see a favourite
actor take leave of the stage. We were present not long ago when
Mr. Bannister quitted it. We do not wonder that his feelings were
overpowered on the occasion: ours were nearly so too. We remembered
him, in the first heyday of our youthful spirits, in the
<cite>Prize</cite>, in which he played so delightfully with that fine old croaker
Suett, and Madame Storace,—in the farce of <cite>My Grandmother</cite>, in the
<cite>Son-in-Law</cite>, in <cite>Autolycus</cite>, and in <cite>Scrub</cite>, in which our satisfaction was
at its height. At that time, King and Parsons, and Dodd, and
Quick, and Edwin were in the full vigour of their reputation, who
are now all gone. We still feel the vivid delight with which we
used to see their names in the play-bills, as we went along to the
Theatre. Bannister was one of the last of these that remained; and
we parted with him as we should with one of our oldest and best
friends. The most pleasant feature in the profession of a player, and
which, indeed, is peculiar to it, is that we not only admire the talents
of those who adorn it, but we contract a personal intimacy with them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>There is no class of society whom so many persons regard with
affection as actors. We greet them on the stage; we like to meet
them in the streets; they almost always recall to us pleasant associations;
and we feel our gratitude excited, without the uneasiness of a
sense of obligation. The very gaiety and popularity, however, which
surround the life of a favourite performer, make the retiring from it
a very serious business. It glances a mortifying reflection on the
shortness of human life, and the vanity of human pleasures. Something
reminds us, that ‘all the world’s a stage, and all the men and
women merely players.’</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 39.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ON THE SAME&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Jan. 5, 1817.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It has been considered as the misfortune of first-rate talents for the
stage, that they leave no record behind them except that of vague
rumour, and that the genius of a great actor perishes with him,
‘leaving the world no copy.’ This is a misfortune, or at least an
unpleasant circumstance, to actors; but it is, perhaps, an advantage
to the stage. It leaves an opening to originality. The stage is
always beginning anew; the candidates for theatrical reputation are
always setting out afresh, unencumbered by the affectation of the
faults or excellences of their predecessors. In this respect, we
should imagine that the average quantity of dramatic talent remains
more nearly the same than that in any other walk of art. In no
other instance do the complaints of the degeneracy of the moderns
seem so unfounded as in this; and Colley Cibber’s account of the
regular decline of the stage, from the time of Shakspeare to that of
Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, and from the time of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> to the beginning of
George <span class='fss'>II.</span> appears quite ridiculous. The stage is a place where
genius is sure to come upon its legs, in a generation or two at farthest.
In the other arts, (as painting and poetry), it has been contended that
what has been well done already, by giving rise to endless vapid
imitations, is an obstacle to what might be done well hereafter: that
the models or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></span></i> of art, where they are accumulated, choke
up the path to excellence; and that the works of genius, where they
can be rendered permanent and handed down from age to age, not
only prevent, but render superfluous, future productions of the same
kind. We have not, neither do we want, two Shakspeares, two
Miltons, two Raphaels, any more than we require two suns in the
same sphere. Even Miss O’Neill stands a little in the way of our
recollections of Mrs. Siddons. But Mr. Kean is an excellent substitute
for the memory of Garrick, whom we never saw. When an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>author dies, it is no matter, for his works remain. When a great
actor dies, there is a void produced in society, a gap which requires
to be filled up. Who does not go to see Kean? Who, if Garrick
were alive, would go to see him? At least one or the other must
have quitted the stage. We have seen what a ferment has been
excited among our living artists by the exhibition of the works of the
old Masters at the British Gallery. What would the actors say to
it, if, by any spell or power of necromancy, all the celebrated actors,
for the last hundred years could be made to appear again on the boards
of Covent Garden and Drury-Lane, for the last time, in all their
most brilliant parts? What a rich treat to the town, what a feast
for the critics, to go and see Betterton, and Booth, and Wilks, and
Sandford, and Nokes, and Leigh, and Penkethman, and Bullock, and
Estcourt, and Dogget, and Mrs. Barry, and Mrs. Montfort, and
Mrs. Oldfield, and Mrs. Bracegirdle, and Mrs. Cibber, and Cibber
himself, the prince of coxcombs, and Macklin, and Quin, and Rich,
and Mrs. Clive, and Mrs. Pritchard, and Mrs. Abington, and Weston,
and Shuter, and Garrick, and all the rest of those who ‘gladdened
life, and whose deaths eclipsed the gaiety of nations’! We should
certainly be there. We should buy a ticket for the season. We
should enjoy <em>our hundred days</em> again. We should not lose a single
night. We would not, for a great deal, be absent from Betterton’s
Hamlet or his Brutus, or from Booth’s Cato, as it was first acted to
the contending applause of Whigs and Tories. We should be in the
first row when Mrs. Barry (who was kept by Lord Rochester, and
with whom Otway was in love) played Monimia or Belvidera; and
we suppose we should go to see Mrs. Bracegirdle (with whom all
the world was in love) in all her parts. We should then know
exactly whether Penkethman’s manner of picking a chicken, and
Bullock’s mode of devouring asparagus, answered to the ingenious
account of them in the Tatler; and whether Dogget was equal to
Dowton—whether Mrs. Montfort<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a> or Mrs. Abington was the finest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>lady—whether Wilks or Cibber was the best Sir Harry Wildair—whether
Macklin was really ‘the Jew that Shakspeare drew,’ and
whether Garrick was, upon the whole, so great an actor as the world
have made him out! Many people have a strong desire to pry into
the secrets of futurity: for our own parts, we should be satisfied if
we had the power to recall the dead, and live the past over again
as often as we pleased! Players, after all, have little reason to complain
of their hard-earned, short-lived popularity. One thunder of
applause from pit, boxes, and gallery, is equal to a whole immortality
of posthumous fame: and when we hear an actor, whose modesty is
equal to his merit, declare, that he would like to see a dog wag his
tail in approbation, what must he feel when he sees the whole house
in a roar! Besides, Fame, as if their reputation had been entrusted
to her alone, has been particularly careful of the renown of her
theatrical favourites: she forgets one by one, and year by year, those
who have been great lawyers, great statesmen, and great warriors in
their day; but the name of Garrick still survives with the works of
Reynolds and of Johnson.</p>

<p class='c000'>Actors have been accused, as a profession, of being extravagant
and dissipated. While they are said to be so as a piece of common
cant, they are likely to continue so. But there is a sentence in
Shakspeare which should be stuck as a label in the mouths of our
beadles and whippers-in of morality: ‘The web of our life is of a
mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud if
our faults whipped them not: and our vices would despair if they
were not cherished by our virtues.’ With respect to the extravagance
of actors, as a traditional character, it is not to be wondered
at. They live from hand to mouth: they plunge from want into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>luxury; they have no means of making money <em>breed</em>, and all professions
that do not live by turning money into money, or have not
a certainty of accumulating it in the end by parsimony, spend it.
Uncertain of the future, they make sure of the present moment.
This is not unwise. Chilled with poverty, steeped in contempt, they
sometimes pass into the sunshine of fortune, and are lifted to the very
pinnacle of public favour; yet even there cannot calculate on the
continuance of success, but are, ‘like the giddy sailor on the mast,
ready with every blast to topple down into the fatal bowels of the
deep!’ Besides, if the young enthusiast, who is smitten with the
stage, and with the public as a mistress, were naturally a close <em>hunks</em>,
he would become or remain a city clerk, instead of turning player.
Again, with respect to the habit of convivial indulgence, an actor,
to be a good one, must have a great spirit of enjoyment in himself,
strong impulses, strong passions, and a strong sense of pleasure: for
it is his business to imitate the passions, and to communicate pleasure
to others. A man of genius is not a machine. The neglected actor
may be excused if he drinks oblivion of his disappointments; the
successful one, if he quaffs the applause of the world, and enjoys the
friendship of those who are the friends of the favourites of fortune,
in draughts of nectar. There is no path so steep as that of fame:
no labour so hard as the pursuit of excellence. The intellectual
excitement, inseparable from those professions which call forth all
our sensibility to pleasure and pain, requires some corresponding
physical excitement to support our failure, and not a little to allay
the ferment of the spirits attendant on success. If there is any
tendency to dissipation beyond this in the profession of a player,
it is owing to the prejudices entertained against them, to that spirit of
bigotry which in a neighbouring country would deny actors Christian
burial after their death, and to that cant of criticism, which, in our
own, slurs over their characters, while living, with a half-witted jest.</p>

<p class='c000'>A London engagement is generally considered by actors as the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne plus ultra</span></i> of their ambition, as ‘a consummation devoutly to be
wished,’ as the great prize in the lottery of their professional life.
But this appears to us, who are not in the secret, to be rather the
prose termination of their adventurous career: it is the provincial
commencement that is the poetical and truly enviable part of it.
After that, they have comparatively little to hope or fear. ‘The
wine of life is drunk, and but the lees remain.’ In London, they
become gentlemen, and the King’s servants: but it is the romantic
mixture of the hero and the vagabond that constitutes the essence of
the player’s life. It is the transition from their real to their assumed
characters, from the contempt of the world to the applause of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>multitude, that gives its zest to the latter, and raises them as much
above common humanity at night, as in the daytime they are depressed
below it. ‘Hurried from fierce extremes, by contrast made more
fierce,’—it is rags and a flock-bed which give their splendour to a
plume of feathers and a throne. We should suppose, that if the
most admired actor on the London stage were brought to confession
on this point, he would acknowledge that all the applause he had
received from ‘brilliant and overflowing audiences,’ was nothing to
the light-headed intoxication of unlooked-for success in a barn. In
town, actors are criticised: in country-places, they are wondered at,
or hooted at: it is of little consequence which, so that the interval
is not too long between. For ourselves, we own that the description
of the strolling player in Gil Blas, soaking his dry crusts in the well
by the roadside, presents to us a perfect picture of human felicity.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>No. 40.</span>]&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; WHY THE ARTS ARE NOT PROGRESSIVE?—A FRAGMENT&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; [<span class='sc'>Jan. 11, 15; Sep. 11, 1814.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It is often made a subject of complaint and surprise, that the arts in
this country, and in modern times, have not kept pace with the general
progress of society and civilisation in other respects, and it has been
proposed to remedy the deficiency by more carefully availing ourselves
of the advantages which time and circumstances have placed within
our reach, but which we have hitherto neglected, the study of the
antique, the formation of academies, and the distribution of prizes.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, the complaint itself, that the arts do not attain that progressive
degree of perfection which might reasonably be expected
from them, proceeds on a false notion, for the analogy appealed to in
support of the regular advances of art to higher degrees of excellence,
totally fails; it applies to science, not to art. Secondly, the
expedients proposed to remedy the evil by adventitious means are only
calculated to confirm it. The arts hold immediate communication
with nature, and are only derived from that source. When that
original impulse no longer exists, when the inspiration of genius is fled,
all the attempts to recal it are no better than the tricks of galvanism
to restore the dead to life. The arts may be said to resemble Antæus
in his struggle with Hercules, who was strangled when he was raised
above the ground, and only revived and recovered his strength when
he touched his mother earth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Nothing is more contrary to the fact than the supposition that in
what we understand by the <em>fine arts</em>, as painting and poetry, relative
perfection is only the result of repeated efforts, and that what has
been once well done constantly leads to something better. What is
mechanical, reducible to rule, or capable of demonstration, is progressive,
and admits of gradual improvement: what is not mechanical
or definite, but depends on genius, taste, and feeling, very soon
becomes stationary or retrograde, and loses more than it gains by
transfusion. The contrary opinion is, indeed, a common error, which
has grown up, like many others, from transferring an analogy of one
kind to something quite distinct, without thinking of the difference in
the nature of the things, or attending to the difference of the results.
For most persons, finding what wonderful advances have been made in
biblical criticism, in chemistry, in mechanics, in geometry, astronomy,
etc.—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, in things depending on mere inquiry and experiment, or on
absolute demonstration, have been led hastily to conclude, that there
was a general tendency in the efforts of the human intellect to improve
by repetition, and in all other arts and institutions to grow perfect and
mature by time. We look back upon the theological creed of our
ancestors, and their discoveries in natural philosophy, with a smile of
pity; science, and the arts connected with it, have all had their
infancy, their youth, and manhood, and seem to have in them no
principle of limitation or decay; and, inquiring no farther about the
matter, we infer, in the height of our self-congratulation, and in the
intoxication of our pride, that the same progress has been, and will
continue to be, made in all other things which are the work of man.
The fact, however, stares us so plainly in the face, that one would
think the smallest reflection must suggest the truth, and overturn our
sanguine theories. The greatest poets, the ablest orators, the best
painters, and the finest sculptors that the world ever saw, appeared
soon after the birth of these arts, and lived in a state of society which
was, in other respects, comparatively barbarous. Those arts, which
depend on individual genius and incommunicable power, have always
leaped at once from infancy to manhood, from the first rude dawn of invention
to their meridian height and dazzling lustre, and have in general
declined ever after. This is the peculiar distinction and privilege of
each, of science and of art; of the one, never to attain its utmost
summit of perfection, and of the other, to arrive at it almost at once.
Homer, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, Dante, and Ariosto (Milton
alone was of a later age, and not the worse for it), Raphael, Titian,
Michael Angelo, Correggio, Cervantes, and Boccaccio—all lived
near the beginning of their arts—perfected, and all but created them.
These giant sons of genius stand, indeed, upon the earth, but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>tower above their fellows, and the long line of their successors does
not interpose any thing to obstruct their view, or lessen their brightness.
In strength and stature they are unrivalled, in grace and beauty they
have never been surpassed. In after-ages, and more refined periods, (as
they are called), great men have arisen one by one, as it were by
throes and at intervals: though in general the best of these cultivated
and artificial minds were of an inferior order, as Tasso and Pope
among poets, Guido and Vandyke among painters. But in the
earliest stages of the arts, when the first mechanical difficulties had
been got over, and the language as it were acquired, they rose by
clusters and in constellations, never to rise again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The arts of painting and poetry are conversant with the world of
thought within us, and with the world of sense without us—with what
we know, and see, and feel intimately. They flow from the sacred
shrine of our own breasts, and are kindled at the living lamp of nature.
The pulse of the passions assuredly beat as high, the depths and
soundings of the human heart were as well understood three thousand
years ago, as they are at present; the face of nature and ‘the human
face divine,’ shone as bright then as they have ever done. It is this
light, reflected by true genius on art, that marks out its path before it,
and sheds a glory round the Muses’ feet, like that which ‘circled
Una’s angel face,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And made a sunshine in the shady place.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nature is the soul of art. There is a strength in the imagination that
reposes entirely on nature, which nothing else can supply. There is
in the old poets and painters a vigour and grasp of mind, a full
possession of their subject, a confidence and firm faith, a sublime
simplicity, an elevation of thought, proportioned to their depth of
feeling, an increasing force and impetus, which moves, penetrates, and
kindles all that comes in contact with it, which seems, not theirs, but
given to them. It is this reliance on the power of nature which has
produced those master-pieces by the Prince of Painters, in which
expression is all in all, where one spirit, that of truth, pervades every
part, brings down heaven to earth, mingles cardinals and popes with
angels and apostles, and yet blends and harmonises the whole by the
true touches and intense feeling of what is beautiful and grand in
nature. It was the same trust in nature that enabled Chaucer to
describe the patient sorrow of Griselda; or the delight of that young
beauty in the Flower and the Leaf, shrouded in her bower, and listening,
in the morning of the year, to the singing of the nightingale, while her
joy rises with the rising song, and gushes out afresh at every pause,
and is borne along with the full tide of pleasure, and still increases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and repeats and prolongs itself, and knows no ebb. It is thus that
Boccaccio, in the divine story of the Hawk, has represented Frederigo
Alberigi steadily contemplating his favourite Falcon (the wreck and
remnant of his fortune), and glad to see how fat and fair a bird she is,
thinking what a dainty repast she would make for his Mistress, who
had deigned to visit him in his low cell. So Isabella mourns over
her pot of Basile, and never asks for any thing but that. So Lear
calls out for his poor fool, and invokes the heavens, for they are old
like him. So Titian impressed on the countenance of that young
Neapolitan nobleman in the Louvre, a look that never passed away.
So Nicolas Poussin describes some shepherds wandering out in a
morning of the spring, and coming to a tomb with this inscription, ‘<span class='sc'>I
also was an Arcadian</span>.’</p>

<p class='c000'>In general, it must happen in the first stages of the Arts, that as
none but those who had a natural genius for them would attempt to
practise them, so none but those who had a natural taste for them
would pretend to judge of or criticise them. This must be an
incalculable advantage to the man of true genius, for it is no other
than the privilege of being tried by his peers. In an age when
connoisseurship had not become a fashion; when religion, war, and
intrigue, occupied the time and thoughts of the great, only those minds
of superior refinement would be led to notice the works of art, who
had a real sense of their excellence; and in giving way to the powerful
bent of his own genius, the painter was most likely to consult the
taste of his judges. He had not to deal with pretenders to taste,
through vanity, affectation, and idleness. He had to appeal to the
higher faculties of the soul; to that deep and innate sensibility to
truth and beauty, which required only a proper object to have its
enthusiasm excited; and to that independent strength of mind, which,
in the midst of ignorance and barbarism, hailed and fostered genius,
wherever it met with it. Titian was patronised by Charles <span class='fss'>V.</span>, Count
Castiglione was the friend of Raphael. These were true patrons, and
true critics; and as there were no others, (for the world, in general,
merely looked on and wondered), there can be little doubt, that such
a period of dearth of factitious patronage would be the most favourable
to the full developement of the greatest talents, and the attainment of
the highest excellence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The diffusion of taste is not the same thing as the improvement of
taste; but it is only the former of these objects that is promoted by
public institutions and other artificial means. The number of candidates
for fame, and of pretenders to criticism, is thus increased beyond
all proportion, while the quantity of genius and feeling remains the
same; with this difference, that the man of genius is lost in the crowd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of competitors, who would never have become such but from encouragement
and example; and that the opinion of those few persons
whom nature intended for judges, is drowned in the noisy suffrages of
shallow smatterers in taste. The principle of universal suffrage, however
applicable to matters of government, which concern the common
feelings and common interests of society, is by no means applicable to
matters of taste, which can only be decided upon by the most refined
understandings. The highest efforts of genius, in every walk of art,
can never be properly understood by the generality of mankind: There
are numberless beauties and truths which lie far beyond their comprehension.
It is only as refinement and sublimity are blended with
other qualities of a more obvious and grosser nature, that they pass
current with the world. Taste is the highest degree of sensibility,
or the impression made on the most cultivated and sensible of minds,
as genius is the result of the highest powers both of feeling and
invention. It may be objected, that the public taste is capable of
gradual improvement, because, in the end, the public do justice to
works of the greatest merit. This is a mistake. The reputation
ultimately, and often slowly affixed to works of genius is stamped
upon them by authority, not by popular consent or the common sense
of the world. We imagine that the admiration of the works of
celebrated men has become common, because the admiration of their
names has become so. But does not every ignorant connoisseur
pretend the same veneration, and talk with the same vapid assurance of
Michael Angelo, though he has never seen even a copy of any of his
pictures, as if he had studied them accurately,—merely because Sir
Joshua Reynolds has praised him? Is Milton more popular now
than when the Paradise Lost was first published? Or does he
not rather owe his reputation to the judgment of a few persons in
every successive period, accumulating in his favour, and overpowering
by its weight the public indifference? Why is Shakspeare popular?
Not from his refinement of character or sentiment, so much as from
his power of telling a story, the variety and invention, the tragic
catastrophe and broad farce of his plays. Spenser is not yet understood.
Does not Boccaccio pass to this day for a writer of ribaldry,
because his jests and lascivious tales were all that caught the vulgar
ear, while the story of the Falcon is forgotten!</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The first edition of the <cite>Characters of Shakespear’s Plays</cite> (5½ in. × 9 in.) was
published in 1817. The imprint reads thus:—London: | Printed by C. H.
Reynell, 21, Piccadilly, | for R. Hunter, successor to Mr. Johnson, | in St. Paul’s
Church-yard; | and C. and J. Ollier, | Welbeck-street, Cavendish-square. | 1817.
The second edition was issued in the following year, and the imprint is:—London: |
Printed for Taylor and Hessey, | 93, Fleet Street. | 1818. There are several
verbal alterations in the second edition, and one curious <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">erratum</span></i>: ‘In <cite>Lear</cite>, p. 173
[p. 269 present edition] dele line “Not an hour more nor less.’” In the text of
the play these words occur between ‘Fourscore and upward’ and ‘And, to deal
plainly.’ The second edition also was printed by C. H. Reynell, Broad-street,
Golden-square. No further edition was published in Hazlitt’s lifetime, and the
present issue has consequently been printed from a copy of the second edition:
the proofs, however, have been read with a copy of the first edition, and one or
two misprints thereby corrected. In 1818 a pirated American edition was published
at Boston.</p>

<p class='c000'>A contemporary criticism of the volume may be found in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>,
1817, by Francis Jeffrey. See also E. L. Bulwer’s <cite>Some Thoughts on the Genius of
Hazlitt</cite>. One hundred pounds was paid to Hazlitt by C. H. Reynell for the
copyright, and the first edition, at half a guinea, was sold in six weeks: an adverse
criticism by William Gifford in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> (No. 36, January 1818)
spoiled the sale of the second edition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following announcement appears on the back of the half-title of the
second edition:—‘This day is published, Lectures on the English Poets, delivered
at the Surry Institution, By William Hazlitt. In one vol. 8vo. price 10s. 6d.’</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>PREFACE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is observed by Mr. Pope, that</p>

<p class='c016'>‘If ever any author deserved the name of an <em>original</em>, it was Shakespear.
Homer himself drew not his art so immediately from the fountains of
nature; it proceeded through Ægyptian strainers and channels, and came
to him not without some tincture of the learning, or some cast of the
models, of those before him. The poetry of Shakespear was inspiration
indeed: he is not so much an imitator, as an instrument of nature; and it
is not so just to say that he speaks from her, as that she speaks through
him.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘His <em>characters</em> are so much nature herself, that it is a sort of injury to
call them by so distant a name as copies of her. Those of other poets
have a constant resemblance, which shows that they received them from
one another, and were but multipliers of the same image: each picture,
like a mock-rainbow, is but the reflection of a reflection. But every single
character in Shakespear, is as much an individual, as those in life itself;
it is as impossible to find any two alike; and such, as from their relation
or affinity in any respect appear most to be twins, will, upon comparison,
be found remarkably distinct. To this life and variety of character, we
must add the wonderful preservation of it; which is such throughout his
plays, that had all the speeches been printed without the very names of
the persons, I believe one might have applied them with certainty to every
speaker.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The object of the volume here offered to the public, is to illustrate
these remarks in a more particular manner by a reference to each
play. A gentleman of the name of Mason, the author of a Treatise
on Ornamental Gardening (not Mason the poet), began a work of a
similar kind about forty years ago, but he only lived to finish a
parallel between the characters of Macbeth and Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span> which
is an exceedingly ingenious piece of analytical criticism. Richardson’s
Essays include but a few of Shakespear’s principal characters.
The only work which seemed to supersede the necessity of an attempt
like the present was Schlegel’s very admirable Lectures on the Drama,
which give by far the best account of the plays of Shakespear that
has hitherto appeared. The only circumstances in which it was
thought not impossible to improve on the manner in which the German
critic has executed this part of his design, were in avoiding an appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of mysticism in his style, not very attractive to the English
reader, and in bringing illustrations from particular passages of the
plays themselves, of which Schlegel’s work, from the extensiveness
of his plan, did not admit. We will at the same time confess, that
some little jealousy of the character of the national understanding was
not without its share in producing the following undertaking, for ‘we
were piqued’ that it should be reserved for a foreign critic to give
‘reasons for the faith which we English have in Shakespear.’ Certainly
no writer among ourselves has shown either the same enthusiastic
admiration of his genius, or the same philosophical acuteness in
pointing out his characteristic excellences. As we have pretty well
exhausted all we had to say upon this subject in the body of the work,
we shall here transcribe Schlegel’s general account of Shakespear,
which is in the following words:—</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Never, perhaps, was there so comprehensive a talent for the delineation
of character as Shakespear’s. It not only grasps the diversities of rank,
sex, and age, down to the dawnings of infancy; not only do the king and
the beggar, the hero and the pickpocket, the sage and the idiot speak and
act with equal truth; not only does he transport himself to distant ages
and foreign nations, and pourtray in the most accurate manner, with only
a few apparent violations of costume, the spirit of the ancient Romans, of
the French in their wars with the English, of the English themselves
during a great part of their history, of the Southern Europeans (in the
serious part of many comedies) the cultivated society of that time, and the
former rude and barbarous state of the North; his human characters have
not only such depth and precision that they cannot be arranged under
classes, and are inexhaustible, even in conception:—no—this Prometheus
not merely forms men, he opens the gates of the magical world of spirits;
calls up the midnight ghost; exhibits before us his witches amidst their
unhallowed mysteries; peoples the air with sportive fairies and sylphs:—and
these beings, existing only in imagination, possess such truth and
consistency, that even when deformed monsters like Caliban, he extorts
the conviction, that if there should be such beings, they would so conduct
themselves. In a word, as he carries with him the most fruitful and
daring fancy into the kingdom of nature,—on the other hand, he carries
nature into the regions of fancy, lying beyond the confines of reality. We
are lost in astonishment at seeing the extraordinary, the wonderful, and the
unheard of, in such intimate nearness.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘If Shakespear deserves our admiration for his characters, he is equally
deserving of it for his exhibition of passion, taking this word in its widest
signification, as including every mental condition, every tone from indifference
or familiar mirth to the wildest rage and despair. He gives us the
history of minds; he lays open to us, in a single word, a whole series of
preceding conditions. His passions do not at first stand displayed to us
in all their height, as is the case with so many tragic poets, who, in the
language of Lessing, are thorough masters of the legal style of love. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>paints, in a most inimitable manner, the gradual progress from the first
origin. “He gives,” as Lessing says, “a living picture of all the most
minute and secret artifices by which a feeling steals into our souls; of all
the imperceptible advantages which it there gains; of all the stratagems
by which every other passion is made subservient to it, till it becomes the
sole tyrant of our desires and our aversions.” Of all poets, perhaps, he
alone has pourtrayed the mental diseases,—melancholy, delirium, lunacy,—with
such inexpressible, and, in every respect, definite truth, that the
physician may enrich his observations from them in the same manner as
from real cases.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘And yet Johnson has objected to Shakespear, that his pathos is not
always natural and free from affectation. There are, it is true, passages,
though, comparatively speaking, very few, where his poetry exceeds the
bounds of true dialogue, where a too soaring imagination, a too luxuriant
wit, rendered the complete dramatic forgetfulness of himself impossible.
With this exception, the censure originates only in a fanciless way of
thinking, to which everything appears unnatural that does not suit its own
tame insipidity. Hence, an idea has been formed of simple and natural
pathos, which consists in exclamations destitute of imagery, and nowise
elevated above every-day life. But energetical passions electrify the whole
of the mental powers, and will, consequently, in highly favoured natures,
express themselves in an ingenious and figurative manner. It has been
often remarked, that indignation gives wit; and, as despair occasionally
breaks out into laughter, it may sometimes also give vent to itself in antithetical
comparisons.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Besides, the rights of the poetical form have not been duly weighed.
Shakespear, who was always sure of his object, to move in a sufficiently
powerful manner when he wished to do so, has occasionally, by indulging
in a freer play, purposely moderated the impressions when too painful, and
immediately introduced a musical alleviation of our sympathy. He had
not those rude ideas of his art which many moderns seem to have, as if the
poet, like the clown in the proverb, must strike twice on the same place.
An ancient rhetorician delivered a caution against dwelling too long on
the excitation of pity; for nothing, he said, dries so soon as tears; and
Shakespear acted conformably to this ingenious maxim, without knowing it.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘The objection, that Shakespear wounds our feelings by the open display
of the most disgusting moral odiousness, harrows up the mind unmercifully,
and tortures even our senses by the exhibition of the most insupportable
and hateful spectacles, is one of much greater importance. He has
never, in fact, varnished over wild and bloodthirsty passions with a pleasing
exterior,—never clothed crime and want of principle with a false show of
greatness of soul; and in that respect he is every way deserving of praise.
Twice he has pourtrayed downright villains; and the masterly way in
which he has contrived to elude impressions of too painful a nature, may
be seen in Iago and Richard the Third. The constant reference to a petty
and puny race must cripple the boldness of the poet. Fortunately for his
art, Shakespear lived in an age extremely susceptible of noble and tender
impressions, but which had still enough of the firmness inherited from a
vigorous olden time not to shrink back with dismay from every strong and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>violent picture. We have lived to see tragedies of which the catastrophe
consists in the swoon of an enamoured princess. If Shakespear falls occasionally
into the opposite extreme, it is a noble error, originating in the
fulness of a gigantic strength: and yet this tragical Titan, who storms
the heavens, and threatens to tear the world from off its hinges; who,
more terrible than Æschylus, makes our hair stand on end, and congeals
our blood with horror, possessed, at the same time, the insinuating loveliness
of the sweetest poetry. He plays with love like a child; and his
songs are breathed out like melting sighs. He unites in his genius the
utmost elevation and the utmost depth; and the most foreign, and even
apparently irreconcileable properties subsist in him peaceably together.
The world of spirits and nature have laid all their treasures at his feet.
In strength a demi-god, in profundity of view a prophet, in all-seeing
wisdom a protecting spirit of a higher order, he lowers himself to mortals,
as if unconscious of his superiority: and is as open and unassuming as a
child.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Shakespear’s comic talent is equally wonderful with that which he has
shown in the pathetic and tragic: it stands on an equal elevation, and
possesses equal extent and profundity. All that I before wished was, not
to admit that the former preponderated. He is highly inventive in comic
situations and motives. It will be hardly possible to show whence he has
taken any of them; whereas, in the serious part of his drama, he has
generally laid hold of something already known. His comic characters
are equally true, various, and profound, with his serious. So little is he
disposed to caricature, that we may rather say many of his traits are almost
too nice and delicate for the stage, that they can only be properly seized
by a great actor, and fully understood by a very acute audience. Not only
has he delineated many kinds of folly; he has also contrived to exhibit
mere stupidity in a most diverting and entertaining manner.’—Vol. ii. p. 145.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have the rather availed ourselves of this testimony of a foreign
critic in behalf of Shakespear, because our own countryman, Dr.
Johnson, has not been so favourable to him. It may be said of
Shakespear, that ‘those who are not for him are against him’: for
indifference is here the height of injustice. We may sometimes, in
order ‘to do a great right, do a little wrong.’ An overstrained
enthusiasm is more pardonable with respect to Shakespear than the
want of it; for our admiration cannot easily surpass his genius. We
have a high respect for Dr. Johnson’s character and understanding,
mixed with something like personal attachment: but he was neither
a poet nor a judge of poetry. He might in one sense be a judge of
poetry as it falls within the limits and rules of prose, but not as it is
poetry. Least of all was he qualified to be a judge of Shakespear,
who ‘alone is high fantastical.’ Let those who have a prejudice
against Johnson read Boswell’s Life of him; as those whom he has
prejudiced against Shakespear should read his Irene. We do not
say that a man to be a critic must necessarily be a poet: but to be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>good critic, he ought not to be a bad poet. Such poetry as a man
deliberately writes, such, and such only will he like. Dr. Johnson’s
Preface to his edition of Shakespear looks like a laborious attempt
to bury the characteristic merits of his author under a load of cumbrous
phraseology, and to weigh his excellences and defects in equal scales,
stuffed full of ‘swelling figures and sonorous epithets.’ Nor could
it well be otherwise; Dr. Johnson’s general powers of reasoning
overlaid his critical susceptibility. All his ideas were cast in a given
mould, in a set form: they were made out by rule and system, by
climax, inference, and antithesis:—Shakespear’s were the reverse.
Johnson’s understanding dealt only in round numbers: the fractions
were lost upon him. He reduced everything to the common standard
of conventional propriety; and the most exquisite refinement or
sublimity produced an effect on his mind, only as they could be
translated into the language of measured prose. To him an excess
of beauty was a fault; for it appeared to him like an excrescence;
and his imagination was dazzled by the blaze of light. His writings
neither shone with the beams of native genius, nor reflected them.
The shifting shapes of fancy, the rainbow hues of things, made no
impression on him: he seized only on the permanent and tangible.
He had no idea of natural objects but ‘such as he could measure
with a two-foot rule, or tell upon ten fingers’: he judged of human
nature in the same way, by mood and figure: he saw only the definite,
the positive, and the practical, the average forms of things, not their
striking differences—their classes, not their degrees. He was a man
of strong common sense and practical wisdom, rather than of genius
or feeling. He retained the regular, habitual impressions of actual
objects, but he could not follow the rapid flights of fancy, or the
strong movements of passion. That is, he was to the poet what the
painter of still life is to the painter of history. Common sense
sympathises with the impressions of things on ordinary minds in
ordinary circumstances: genius catches the glancing combinations
presented to the eye of fancy, under the influence of passion. It is
the province of the didactic reasoner to take cognizance of those
results of human nature which are constantly repeated and always
the same, which follow one another in regular succession, which are
acted upon by large classes of men, and embodied in received customs,
laws, language, and institutions; and it was in arranging, comparing,
and arguing on these kind of general results, that Johnson’s excellence
lay. But he could not quit his hold of the common-place and
mechanical, and apply the general rule to the particular exception, or
shew how the nature of man was modified by the workings of passion,
or the infinite fluctuations of thought and accident. Hence he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>judge neither of the heights nor depths of poetry. Nor is this all;
for being conscious of great powers in himself, and those powers of
an adverse tendency to those of his author, he would be for setting
up a foreign jurisdiction over poetry, and making criticism a kind of
Procrustes’ bed of genius, where he might cut down imagination to
matter-of-fact, regulate the passions according to reason, and translate
the whole into logical diagrams and rhetorical declamation. Thus
he says of Shakespear’s characters, in contradiction to what Pope
had observed, and to what every one else feels, that each character
is a species, instead of being an individual. He in fact found the
general species or <em>didactic</em> form in Shakespear’s characters, which was
all he sought or cared for; he did not find the individual traits, or
the <em>dramatic</em> distinctions which Shakespear has engrafted on this
general nature, because he felt no interest in them. Shakespear’s
bold and happy flights of imagination were equally thrown away upon
our author. He was not only without any particular fineness of
organic sensibility, alive to all the ‘mighty world of ear and eye,’
which is necessary to the painter or musician, but without that intenseness
of passion, which, seeking to exaggerate whatever excites
the feelings of pleasure or power in the mind, and moulding the
impressions of natural objects according to the impulses of imagination,
produces a genius and a taste for poetry. According to Dr. Johnson,
a mountain is sublime, or a rose is beautiful; for that their name and
definition imply. But he would no more be able to give the description
of Dover cliff in <cite>Lear</cite>, or the description of flowers in <cite>The
Winter’s Tale</cite>, than to describe the objects of a sixth sense; nor do
we think he would have any very profound feeling of the beauty of
the passages here referred to. A stately common-place, such as
Congreve’s description of a ruin in the <cite>Mourning Bride</cite>, would have
answered Johnson’s purpose just as well, or better than the first; and
an indiscriminate profusion of scents and hues would have interfered
less with the ordinary routine of his imagination than Perdita’s lines,
which seem enamoured of their own sweetness—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——‘Daffodils</div>
      <div class='line'>That come before the swallow dares, and take</div>
      <div class='line'>The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,</div>
      <div class='line'>But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or Cytherea’s breath.’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>No one who does not feel the passion which these objects inspire
can go along with the imagination which seeks to express that passion
and the uneasy sense of delight accompanying it by something still
more beautiful, and no one can feel this passionate love of nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>without quick natural sensibility. To a mere literal and formal
apprehension, the inimitably characteristic epithet, ‘violets <em>dim</em>,’ must
seem to imply a defect, rather than a beauty; and to any one, not
feeling the full force of that epithet, which suggests an image like
‘the sleepy eye of love,’ the allusion to ‘the lids of Juno’s eyes’
must appear extravagant and unmeaning. Shakespear’s fancy lent
words and images to the most refined sensibility to nature, struggling
for expression: his descriptions are identical with the things themselves,
seen through the fine medium of passion: strip them of that
connection, and try them by ordinary conceptions and ordinary rules,
and they are as grotesque and barbarous as you please!—By thus
lowering Shakespear’s genius to the standard of common-place invention,
it was easy to show that his faults were as great as his
beauties; for the excellence, which consists merely in a conformity
to rules, is counterbalanced by the technical violation of them.
Another circumstance which led to Dr. Johnson’s indiscriminate
praise or censure of Shakespear, is the very structure of his style.
Johnson wrote a kind of rhyming prose, in which he was as much
compelled to finish the different clauses of his sentences, and to
balance one period against another, as the writer of heroic verse is
to keep to lines of ten syllables with similar terminations. He no
sooner acknowledges the merits of his author in one line than the
periodical revolution of his style carries the weight of his opinion
completely over to the side of objection, thus keeping up a perpetual
alternation of perfections and absurdities. We do not otherwise
know how to account for such assertions as the following:—</p>

<p class='c016'>‘In his tragic scenes, there is always something wanting, but his comedy
often surpasses expectation or desire. His comedy pleases by the thoughts
and the language, and his tragedy, for the greater part, by incident and
action. His tragedy seems to be skill, his comedy to be instinct.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet after saying that ‘his tragedy was skill,’ he affirms in the next
page,</p>

<p class='c016'>‘His declamations or set speeches are commonly cold and weak, <em>for his
power was the power of nature</em>: when he endeavoured, like other tragic
writers, to catch opportunities of amplification, and instead of inquiring
what the occasion demanded, to shew how much his stores of knowledge
could supply, he seldom escapes without the pity or resentment of his
reader.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Shakespear! Between the charges here brought against him,
of want of nature in the first instance, and of want of skill in the
second, he could hardly escape being condemned. And again,</p>

<p class='c016'>‘But the admirers of this great poet have most reason to complain when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>he approaches nearest to his highest excellence, and seems fully resolved
to sink them in dejection, or mollify them with tender emotions by the
fall of greatness, the danger of innocence, or the crosses of love. What
he does best, he soon ceases to do. He no sooner begins to move than he
counteracts himself; and terror and pity, as they are rising in the mind,
are checked and blasted by sudden frigidity.’</p>

<p class='c000'>In all this, our critic seems more bent on maintaining the equilibrium
of his style than the consistency or truth of his opinions.—If
Dr. Johnson’s opinion was right, the following observations on
Shakespear’s Plays must be greatly exaggerated, if not ridiculous.
If he was wrong, what has been said may perhaps account for his
being so, without detracting from his ability and judgment in other
things.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is proper to add, that the account of the <cite>Midsummer’s Night’s
Dream</cite> has appeared in another work.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

    <div>CHARACTERS OF SHAKESPEAR’S PLAYS</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>CYMBELINE</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> is one of the most delightful of Shakespear’s historical
plays. It may be considered as a dramatic romance, in which the
most striking parts of the story are thrown into the form of a dialogue,
and the intermediate circumstances are explained by the different
speakers, as occasion renders it necessary. The action is less concentrated
in consequence; but the interest becomes more aerial and
refined from the principle of perspective introduced into the subject
by the imaginary changes of scene, as well as by the length of time
it occupies. The reading of this play is like going a journey with
some uncertain object at the end of it, and in which the suspense is
kept up and heightened by the long intervals between each action.
Though the events are scattered over such an extent of surface, and
relate to such a variety of characters, yet the links which bind the
different interests of the story together are never entirely broken.
The most straggling and seemingly casual incidents are contrived in
such a manner as to lead at last to the most complete developement of
the catastrophe. The ease and conscious unconcern with which this
is effected only makes the skill more wonderful. The business of
the plot evidently thickens in the last act: the story moves forward
with increasing rapidity at every step; its various ramifications are
drawn from the most distant points to the same centre; the principal
characters are brought together, and placed in very critical situations;
and the fate of almost every person in the drama is made to depend
on the solution of a single circumstance—the answer of Iachimo to
the question of Imogen respecting the obtaining of the ring from
Posthumus. Dr. Johnson is of opinion that Shakespear was generally
inattentive to the winding-up of his plots. We think the contrary is
true; and we might cite in proof of this remark not only the present
play, but the conclusion of <cite>Lear</cite>, of <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, of <cite>Macbeth</cite>, of
<cite>Othello</cite>, even of <cite>Hamlet</cite>, and of other plays of less moment, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the last act is crowded with decisive events brought about by natural
and striking means.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pathos in <span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> is not violent or tragical, but of the most
pleasing and amiable kind. A certain tender gloom overspreads the
whole. Posthumus is the ostensible hero of the piece, but its greatest
charm is the character of Imogen. Posthumus is only interesting
from the interest she takes in him; and she is only interesting herself
from her tenderness and constancy to her husband. It is the peculiar
excellence of Shakespear’s heroines, that they seem to exist only in
their attachment to others. They are pure abstractions of the affections.
We think as little of their persons as they do themselves,
because we are let into the secrets of their hearts, which are more
important. We are too much interested in their affairs to stop to
look at their faces, except by stealth and at intervals. No one ever
hit the true perfection of the female character, the sense of weakness
leaning on the strength of its affections for support, so well as
Shakespear—no one ever so well painted natural tenderness free
from affectation and disguise—no one else ever so well shewed how
delicacy and timidity, when driven to extremity, grow romantic and
extravagant; for the romance of his heroines (in which they abound)
is only an excess of the habitual prejudices of their sex, scrupulous
of being false to their vows, truant to their affections, and taught by
the force of feeling when to forego the forms of propriety for the
essence of it. His women were in this respect exquisite logicians;
for there is nothing so logical as passion. They knew their own
minds exactly; and only followed up a favourite purpose, which
they had sworn to with their tongues, and which was engraven on
their hearts, into its untoward consequences. They were the prettiest
little set of martyrs and confessors on record.—Cibber, in speaking
of the early English stage, accounts for the want of prominence and
theatrical display in Shakespear’s female characters from the circumstance,
that women in those days were not allowed to play the parts
of women, which made it necessary to keep them a good deal in the
back-ground. Does not this state of manners itself, which prevented
their exhibiting themselves in public, and confined them to the relations
and charities of domestic life, afford a truer explanation of the
matter? His women are certainly very unlike stage-heroines; the
reverse of tragedy-queens.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have almost as great an affection for Imogen as she had for
Posthumus; and she deserves it better. Of all Shakespear’s women
she is perhaps the most tender and the most artless. Her incredulity
in the opening scene with Iachimo, as to her husband’s infidelity,
is much the same as Desdemona’s backwardness to believe Othello’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>jealousy. Her answer to the most distressing part of the picture is
only, ‘My lord, I fear, has forgot Britain.’ Her readiness to pardon
Iachimo’s false imputations and his designs against herself, is a good
lesson to prudes; and may shew that where there is a real attachment
to virtue, it has no need to bolster itself up with an outrageous or
affected antipathy to vice. The scene in which Pisanio gives Imogen
his master’s letter, accusing her of incontinency on the treacherous
suggestions of Iachimo, is as touching as it is possible for anything
to be:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When Pisanio, who had been charged to kill his mistress, puts her
in a way to live, she says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>And when Pisanio, enlarging on the consequences, tells her she

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In her journey thus disguised to Milford-Haven, she loses her guide
and her way; and unbosoming her complaints, says beautifully—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——‘My dear lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art one of the false ones; now I think on thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>My hunger’s gone; but even before, I was</div>
      <div class='line'>At point to sink for food.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>She afterwards finds, as she thinks, the dead body of Posthumus,
and engages herself as a footboy to serve a Roman officer, when she
has done all due obsequies to him whom she calls her former
master—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——‘And when</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now this is the very religion of love. She all along relies little
on her personal charms, which she fears may have been eclipsed by
some painted Jay of Italy; she relies on her merit, and her merit
is in the depth of her love, her truth and constancy. Our admiration
of her beauty is excited with as little consciousness as possible on her
part. There are two delicious descriptions given of her, one when
she is asleep, and one when she is supposed dead. Arviragus thus
addresses her—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——‘With fairest flowers,</div>

      <div class='line'>The leaf of eglantine, which not to slander,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out-sweeten’d not thy breath.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>The yellow Iachimo gives another thus, when he steals into her
bedchamber:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>——‘Cytherea,</div>
      <div class='line'>How bravely thou becom’st thy bed! Fresh lily,</div>
      <div class='line'>And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch—</div>
      <div class='line'>But kiss, one kiss—’Tis her breathing that</div>
      <div class='line'>Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o’ th’ taper</div>
      <div class='line'>Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids</div>
      <div class='line'>To see th’ enclosed lights now canopied</div>
      <div class='line'>Under the windows, white and azure, laced</div>
      <div class='line'>With blue of Heav’n’s own tinct—on her left breast</div>
      <div class='line'>A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ th’ bottom of a cowslip.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is a moral sense in the proud beauty of this last image, a
rich surfeit of the fancy,—as that well-known passage beginning, ‘Me
of my lawful pleasure she restrained, and prayed me oft forbearance,’
sets a keener edge upon it by the inimitable picture of modesty and
self-denial.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of Cloten, the conceited, booby lord, and rejected
lover of Imogen, though not very agreeable in itself, and at present
obsolete, is drawn with much humour and quaint extravagance. The
description which Imogen gives of his unwelcome addresses to her—‘Whose
love-suit hath been to me as fearful as a siege’—is enough
to cure the most ridiculous lover of his folly. It is remarkable that
though Cloten makes so poor a figure in love, he is described as
assuming an air of consequence as the Queen’s son in a council of
state, and with all the absurdity of his person and manners, is not
without shrewdness in his observations. So true is it that folly is as
often owing to a want of proper sentiments as to a want of understanding!
The exclamation of the ancient critic—Oh Menander
and Nature, which of you copied from the other! would not be
misapplied to Shakespear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other characters in this play are represented with great truth
and accuracy, and as it happens in most of the author’s works, there
is not only the utmost keeping in each separate character; but in the
casting of the different parts, and their relation to one another, there
is an affinity and harmony, like what we may observe in the gradations
of colour in a picture. The striking and powerful contrasts in which
Shakespear abounds could not escape observation; but the use he
makes of the principle of analogy to reconcile the greatest diversities
of character and to maintain a continuity of feeling throughout, has
not been sufficiently attended to. In <span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>, for instance, the
principal interest arises out of the unalterable fidelity of Imogen to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>her husband under the most trying circumstances. Now the other
parts of the picture are filled up with subordinate examples of the
same feeling, variously modified by different situations, and applied
to the purposes of virtue or vice. The plot is aided by the amorous
importunities of Cloten, by the persevering determination of Iachimo
to conceal the defeat of his project by a daring imposture: the
faithful attachment of Pisanio to his mistress is an affecting accompaniment
to the whole; the obstinate adherence to his purpose in
Bellarius, who keeps the fate of the young princes so long a secret
in resentment for the ungrateful return to his former services, the
incorrigible wickedness of the Queen, and even the blind uxorious
confidence of Cymbeline, are all so many lines of the same story,
tending to the same point. The effect of this coincidence is rather
felt than observed; and as the impression exists unconsciously in the
mind of the reader, so it probably arose in the same manner in the
mind of the author, not from design, but from the force of natural
association, a particular train of thought suggesting different inflections
of the same predominant feeling, melting into, and strengthening one
another, like chords in music.</p>

<p class='c000'>The characters of Bellarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus, and the
romantic scenes in which they appear, are a fine relief to the intrigues
and artificial refinements of the court from which they are banished.
Nothing can surpass the wildness and simplicity of the descriptions
of the mountain life they lead. They follow the business of huntsmen,
not of shepherds; and this is in keeping with the spirit of adventure
and uncertainty in the rest of the story, and with the scenes in which
they are afterwards called on to act. How admirably the youthful
fire and impatience to emerge from their obscurity in the young
princes is opposed to the cooler calculations and prudent resignation
of their more experienced counsellor! How well the disadvantages
of knowledge and of ignorance, of solitude and society, are placed
against each other!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Guiderius.</em> Out of your proof you speak: we poor unfledg’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Have never wing’d from view o’ th’ nest; nor know not</div>
      <div class='line'>What air’s from home. Haply this life is best,</div>
      <div class='line'>If quiet life is best; sweeter to you</div>
      <div class='line'>That have a sharper known; well corresponding</div>
      <div class='line'>With your stiff age: but unto us it is</div>
      <div class='line'>A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>A prison for a debtor, that not dares</div>
      <div class='line'>To stride a limit.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Arviragus.</em> What should we speak of</div>
      <div class='line'>When we are old as you? When we shall hear</div>
      <div class='line'>The rain and wind beat dark December! How,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse</div>
      <div class='line'>The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing.</div>
      <div class='line'>We are beastly; subtle as the fox for prey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat:</div>
      <div class='line'>Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage</div>
      <div class='line'>We make a quire, as doth the prison’d bird,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sing our bondage freely.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The answer of Bellarius to this expostulation is hardly satisfactory;
for nothing can be an answer to hope, or the passion of the mind for
unknown good, but experience.—The forest of Arden in <cite>As You Like It</cite>
can alone compare with the mountain scenes in <span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span>: yet how
different the contemplative quiet of the one from the enterprising
boldness and precarious mode of subsistence in the other! Shakespear
not only lets us into the minds of his characters, but gives a tone and
colour to the scenes he describes from the feelings of their supposed
inhabitants. He at the same time preserves the utmost propriety of
action and passion, and gives all their local accompaniments. If he
was equal to the greatest things, he was not above an attention to
the smallest. Thus the gallant sportsmen in <span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> have to
encounter the abrupt declivities of hill and valley: Touchstone and
Audrey jog along a level path. The deer in <span class='sc'>Cymbeline</span> are only
regarded as objects of prey, ‘The game’s a-foot,’ etc.—with Jaques
they are fine subjects to moralise upon at leisure, ‘under the shade of
melancholy boughs.’</p>

<p class='c000'>We cannot take leave of this play, which is a favourite with us,
without noticing some occasional touches of natural piety and morality.
We may allude here to the opening of the scene in which Bellarius
instructs the young princes to pay their orisons to heaven:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——‘See, boys! this gate</div>
      <div class='line'>Instructs you how t’ adore the Heav’ns; and bows you</div>
      <div class='line'>To morning’s holy office.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Guiderius.</em> Hail, Heav’n!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Arviragus.</em> Hail, Heav’n!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Bellarius.</em> Now for our mountain-sport, up to yon hill.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>What a grace and unaffected spirit of piety breathes in this passage!
In like manner, one of the brothers says to the other, when about
to perform the funeral rites to Fidele,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Nay, Cadwall, we must lay his head to the east;</div>
      <div class='line'>My Father hath a reason for ‘t’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>—as if some allusion to the doctrines of the Christian faith had been
casually dropped in conversation by the old man, and had been no
farther inquired into.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Shakespear’s morality is introduced in the same simple, unobtrusive
manner. Imogen will not let her companions stay away from the
chase to attend her when sick, and gives her reason for it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Stick to your journal course; <em>the breach of custom</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Is breach of all</em>!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When the Queen attempts to disguise her motives for procuring
the poison from Cornelius, by saying she means to try its effects on
‘creatures not worth the hanging,’ his answer conveys at once a tacit
reproof of her hypocrisy, and a useful lesson of humanity—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——‘Your Highness</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>MACBETH</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The poet’s eye in a fine frenzy rolling</div>
      <div class='line'>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</div>
      <div class='line'>And as imagination bodies forth</div>
      <div class='line'>The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</div>
      <div class='line'>Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing</div>
      <div class='line'>A local habitation and a name.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> and <cite>Lear</cite>, <cite>Othello</cite> and <cite>Hamlet</cite>, are usually reckoned Shakespear’s
four principal tragedies. <cite>Lear</cite> stands first for the profound
intensity of the passion; <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> for the wildness of the imagination
and the rapidity of the action; <cite>Othello</cite> for the progressive interest and
powerful alternations of feeling; <cite>Hamlet</cite> for the refined developement
of thought and sentiment. If the force of genius shewn in each of
these works is astonishing, their variety is not less so. They are
like different creations of the same mind, not one of which has the
slightest reference to the rest. This distinctness and originality is
indeed the necessary consequence of truth and nature. Shakespear’s
genius alone appeared to possess the resources of nature. He is
‘your only <em>tragedy-maker</em>.’ His plays have the force of things upon
the mind. What he represents is brought home to the bosom as a
part of our experience, implanted in the memory as if we had known
the places, persons, and things of which he treats. <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> is like
a record of a preternatural and tragical event. It has the rugged
severity of an old chronicle with all that the imagination of the poet
can engraft upon traditional belief. The castle of Macbeth, round
which ‘the air smells wooingly,’ and where ‘the temple-haunting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>martlet builds,’ has a real subsistence in the mind; the Weïrd Sisters
meet us in person on ‘the blasted heath’; the ‘air-drawn dagger’
moves slowly before our eyes; the ‘gracious Duncan,’ the ‘blood-boultered
Banquo’ stand before us; all that passed through the mind
of Macbeth passes, without the loss of a tittle, through ours. All
that could actually take place, and all that is only possible to be
conceived, what was said and what was done, the workings of passion,
the spells of magic, are brought before us with the same absolute
truth and vividness—Shakespear excelled in the openings of his
plays: that of <span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> is the most striking of any. The wildness
of the scenery, the sudden shifting of the situations and characters,
the bustle, the expectations excited, are equally extraordinary. From
the first entrance of the Witches and the description of them when
they meet Macbeth,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——‘What are these</div>
      <div class='line'>So wither’d and so wild in their attire,</div>
      <div class='line'>That look not like the inhabitants of th’ earth</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet are on’t?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>the mind is prepared for all that follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>This tragedy is alike distinguished for the lofty imagination it
displays, and for the tumultuous vehemence of the action; and the
one is made the moving principle of the other. The overwhelming
pressure of preternatural agency urges on the tide of human passion
with redoubled force. Macbeth himself appears driven along by the
violence of his fate like a vessel drifting before a storm: he reels to
and fro like a drunken man; he staggers under the weight of his own
purposes and the suggestions of others; he stands at bay with his
situation; and from the superstitious awe and breathless suspense
into which the communications of the Weïrd Sisters throw him, is
hurried on with daring impatience to verify their predictions, and
with impious and bloody hand to tear aside the veil which hides the
uncertainty of the future. He is not equal to the struggle with fate
and conscience. He now ‘bends up each corporal instrument to the
terrible feat’; at other times his heart misgives him, and he is cowed
and abashed by his success. ‘The deed, no less than the attempt,
confounds him.’ His mind is assailed by the stings of remorse, and
full of ‘preternatural solicitings.’ His speeches and soliloquies are
dark riddles on human life, baffling solution, and entangling him in
their labyrinths. In thought he is absent and perplexed, sudden and
desperate in act, from a distrust of his own resolution. His energy
springs from the anxiety and agitation of his mind. His blindly
rushing forward on the objects of his ambition and revenge, or his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>recoiling from them, equally betrays the harassed state of his feelings.—This
part of his character is admirably set off by being brought in
connection with that of Lady Macbeth, whose obdurate strength of
will and masculine firmness give her the ascendancy over her husband’s
faltering virtue. She at once seizes on the opportunity that offers
for the accomplishment of all their wished-for greatness, and never
flinches from her object till all is over. The magnitude of her
resolution almost covers the magnitude of her guilt. She is a great
bad woman, whom we hate, but whom we fear more than we hate.
She does not excite our loathing and abhorrence like Regan and
Gonerill. She is only wicked to gain a great end; and is perhaps
more distinguished by her commanding presence of mind and inexorable
self-will, which do not suffer her to be diverted from a bad
purpose, when once formed, by weak and womanly regrets, than by
the hardness of her heart or want of natural affections. The impression
which her lofty determination of character makes on the
mind of Macbeth is well described where he exclaims,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——‘Bring forth men children only;</div>
      <div class='line'>For thy undaunted mettle should compose</div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing but males!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nor do the pains she is at to ‘screw his courage to the sticking-place,’
the reproach to him, not to be ‘lost so poorly in himself,’
the assurance that ‘a little water clears them of this deed,’ show
anything but her greater consistency in depravity. Her strong-nerved
ambition furnishes ribs of steel to ‘the sides of his intent’;
and she is herself wound up to the execution of her baneful project
with the same unshrinking fortitude in crime, that in other circumstances
she would probably have shown patience in suffering. The
deliberate sacrifice of all other considerations to the gaining ‘for
their future days and nights sole sovereign sway and masterdom,’ by
the murder of Duncan, is gorgeously expressed in her invocation on
hearing of ‘his fatal entrance under her battlements’:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>——‘Come all you spirits</div>
      <div class='line'>That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here:</div>
      <div class='line'>And fill me, from the crown to th’ toe, top-full</div>
      <div class='line'>Of direst cruelty; make thick my blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stop up the access and passage to remorse,</div>
      <div class='line'>That no compunctious visitings of nature</div>
      <div class='line'>Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between</div>
      <div class='line'>The effect and it. Come to my woman’s breasts,</div>
      <div class='line'>And take my milk for gall, you murthering ministers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherever in your sightless substances</div>
      <div class='line'>You wait on nature’s mischief. Come, thick night!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,</div>
      <div class='line'>That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor heav’n peep through the blanket of the dark,</div>
      <div class='line'>To cry, hold, hold!’——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When she first hears that ‘Duncan comes there to sleep’ she is so
overcome by the news, which is beyond her utmost expectations, that
she answers the messenger, ‘Thou’rt mad to say it’: and on receiving
her husband’s account of the predictions of the Witches, conscious
of his instability of purpose, and that her presence is necessary to
goad him on to the consummation of his promised greatness, she
exclaims—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——‘Hie thee hither,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And chastise with the valour of my tongue</div>
      <div class='line'>All that impedes thee from the golden round,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem</div>
      <div class='line'>To have thee crowned withal.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This swelling exultation and keen spirit of triumph, this uncontroulable
eagerness of anticipation, which seems to dilate her form and
take possession of all her faculties, this solid, substantial flesh and
blood display of passion, exhibit a striking contrast to the cold,
abstracted, gratuitous, servile malignity of the Witches, who are
equally instrumental in urging Macbeth to his fate for the mere love
of mischief, and from a disinterested delight in deformity and cruelty.
They are hags of mischief, obscene panders to iniquity, malicious
from their impotence of enjoyment, enamoured of destruction, because
they are themselves unreal, abortive, half-existences—who become
sublime from their exemption from all human sympathies and contempt
for all human affairs, as Lady Macbeth does by the force of
passion! Her fault seems to have been an excess of that strong
principle of self-interest and family aggrandisement, not amenable to
the common feelings of compassion and justice, which is so marked
a feature in barbarous nations and times. A passing reflection of
this kind, on the resemblance of the sleeping king to her father, alone
prevents her from slaying Duncan with her own hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>In speaking of the character of Lady Macbeth, we ought not to
pass over Mrs. Siddons’s manner of acting that part. We can conceive
of nothing grander. It was something above nature. It seemed
almost as if a being of a superior order had dropped from a higher
sphere to awe the world with the majesty of her appearance. Power
was seated on her brow, passion emanated from her breast as from a
shrine; she was tragedy personified. In coming on in the sleeping-scene,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>her eyes were open, but their sense was shut. She was like
a person bewildered and unconscious of what she did. Her lips
moved involuntarily—all her gestures were involuntary and mechanical.
She glided on and off the stage like an apparition. To have seen
her in that character was an event in every one’s life, not to be
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dramatic beauty of the character of Duncan, which excites
the respect and pity even of his murderers, has been often pointed
out. It forms a picture of itself. An instance of the author’s power
of giving a striking effect to a common reflection, by the manner of
introducing it, occurs in a speech of Duncan, complaining of his
having been deceived in his opinion of the Thane of Cawdor, at the
very moment that he is expressing the most unbounded confidence in
the loyalty and services of Macbeth.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘There is no art</div>
      <div class='line'>To find the mind’s construction in the face:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another passage to show that Shakespear lost sight of nothing
that could in any way give relief or heightening to his subject, is the
conversation which takes place between Banquo and Fleance immediately
before the murder-scene of Duncan.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

  </div>

<p class='c000'>In like manner, a fine idea is given of the gloomy coming on of

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span><span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> (generally speaking) is done upon a stronger and more
systematic principle of contrast than any other of Shakespear’s plays.
It moves upon the verge of an abyss, and is a constant struggle
between life and death. The action is desperate and the reaction is
dreadful. It is a huddling together of fierce extremes, a war of
opposite natures which of them shall destroy the other. There is
nothing but what has a violent end or violent beginnings. The lights
and shades are laid on with a determined hand; the transitions from
triumph to despair, from the height of terror to the repose of death,
are sudden and startling; every passion brings in its fellow-contrary,
and the thoughts pitch and jostle against each other as in the dark.
The whole play is an unruly chaos of strange and forbidden things,
where the ground rocks under our feet. Shakespear’s genius here
took its full swing, and trod upon the farthest bounds of nature and
passion. This circumstance will account for the abruptness and
violent antitheses of the style, the throes and labour which run through
the expression, and from defects will turn them into beauties. ‘So
fair and foul a day I have not seen,’ etc. ‘Such welcome and
unwelcome news together.’ ‘Men’s lives are like the flowers in
their caps, dying or ere they sicken.’ ‘Look like the innocent
flower, but be the serpent under it.’ The scene before the castle-gate
follows the appearance of the Witches on the heath, and is
followed by a midnight murder. Duncan is cut off betimes by treason
leagued with witchcraft, and Macduff is ripped untimely from his
mother’s womb to avenge his death. Macbeth, after the death of
Banquo, wishes for his presence in extravagant terms, ‘To him and
all we thirst,’ and when his ghost appears, cries out, ‘Avaunt and
quit my sight,’ and being gone, he is ‘himself again.’ Macbeth
resolves to get rid of Macduff, that ‘he may sleep in spite of thunder’;
and cheers his wife on the doubtful intelligence of Banquo’s taking-off
with the encouragement—‘Then be thou jocund: ere the bat has
flown his cloistered flight; ere to black Hecate’s summons the
shard-born beetle has rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done—a
deed of dreadful note.’ In Lady Macbeth’s speech ‘Had he
not resembled my father as he slept, I had done’t,’ there is murder
and filial piety together; and in urging him to fulfil his vengeance
against the defenceless king, her thoughts spare the blood neither of
infants nor old age. The description of the Witches is full of the
same contradictory principle; they ‘rejoice when good kings bleed,’
they are neither of the earth nor the air, but both; ‘they should be
women, but their beards forbid it’; they take all the pains possible
to lead Macbeth on to the height of his ambition, only to betray him
‘in deeper consequence,’ and after showing him all the pomp of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>art, discover their malignant delight in his disappointed hopes, by
that bitter taunt, ‘Why stands Macbeth thus amazedly?’ We might
multiply such instances every where.</p>

<p class='c000'>The leading features in the character of Macbeth are striking
enough, and they form what may be thought at first only a bold,
rude, Gothic outline. By comparing it with other characters of the
same author we shall perceive the absolute truth and identity which
is observed in the midst of the giddy whirl and rapid career of events.
Macbeth in Shakespear no more loses his identity of character in the
fluctuations of fortune or the storm of passion, than Macbeth in himself
would have lost the identity of his person. Thus he is as distinct
a being from Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span> as it is possible to imagine, though these
two characters in common hands, and indeed in the hands of any
other poet, would have been a repetition of the same general idea,
more or less exaggerated. For both are tyrants, usurpers, murderers,
both aspiring and ambitious, both courageous, cruel, treacherous.
But Richard is cruel from nature and constitution. Macbeth becomes
so from accidental circumstances. Richard is from his birth deformed
in body and mind, and naturally incapable of good. Macbeth is
full of ‘the milk of human kindness,’ is frank, sociable, generous.
He is tempted to the commission of guilt by golden opportunities, by
the instigations of his wife, and by prophetic warnings. Fate and
metaphysical aid conspire against his virtue and his loyalty. Richard
on the contrary needs no prompter, but wades through a series of
crimes to the height of his ambition from the ungovernable violence
of his temper and a reckless love of mischief. He is never gay but
in the prospect or in the success of his villainies: Macbeth is full of
horror at the thoughts of the murder of Duncan, which he is with
difficulty prevailed on to commit, and of remorse after its perpetration.
Richard has no mixture of common humanity in his composition, no
regard to kindred or posterity, he owns no fellowship with others, he
is ‘himself alone.’ Macbeth is not destitute of feelings of sympathy,
is accessible to pity, is even made in some measure the dupe of
his uxoriousness, ranks the loss of friends, of the cordial love of
his followers, and of his good name, among the causes which
have made him weary of life, and regrets that he has ever seized
the crown by unjust means, since he cannot transmit it to his
posterity—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘For Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind—</div>
      <div class='line'>For them the gracious Duncan have I murther’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the agitation of his mind, he envies those whom he has sent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>peace. ‘Duncan is in his grave; after life’s fitful fever he sleeps
well.’—It is true, he becomes more callous as he plunges deeper in
guilt, ‘direness is thus rendered familiar to his slaughterous thoughts,’
and he in the end anticipates his wife in the boldness and bloodiness
of his enterprises, while she for want of the same stimulus of action,
‘is troubled with thick-coming fancies that rob her of her rest,’ goes
mad and dies. Macbeth endeavours to escape from reflection on his
crimes by repelling their consequences, and banishes remorse for the
past by the meditation of future mischief. This is not the principle
of Richard’s cruelty, which displays the wanton malice of a fiend as
much as the frailty of human passion. Macbeth is goaded on to acts
of violence and retaliation by necessity; to Richard, blood is a
pastime.—There are other decisive differences inherent in the two
characters. Richard may be regarded as a man of the world, a
plotting, hardened knave, wholly regardless of every thing but his own
ends, and the means to secure them.—Not so Macbeth. The superstitions
of the age, the rude state of society, the local scenery and
customs, all give a wildness and imaginary grandeur to his character.
From the strangeness of the events that surround him, he is full of
amazement and fear; and stands in doubt between the world of
reality and the world of fancy. He sees sights not shown to mortal
eye, and hears unearthly music. All is tumult and disorder within
and without his mind; his purposes recoil upon himself, are broken
and disjointed; he is the double thrall of his passions and his evil
destiny. Richard is not a character either of imagination or pathos,
but of pure self-will. There is no conflict of opposite feelings in his
breast. The apparitions which he sees only haunt him in his sleep;
nor does he live like Macbeth in a waking dream. Macbeth has
considerable energy and manliness of character; but then he is
‘subject to all the skyey influences.’ He is sure of nothing but the
present moment. Richard in the busy turbulence of his projects
never loses his self-possession, and makes use of every circumstance
that happens as an instrument of his long-reaching designs. In his
last extremity we can only regard him as a wild beast taken in the
toils: while we never entirely lose our concern for Macbeth; and
he calls back all our sympathy by that fine close of thoughtful
melancholy—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘My way of life is fallen into the sear,</div>
      <div class='line'>The yellow leaf; and that which should accompany old age,</div>
      <div class='line'>As honour, troops of friends, I must not look to have;</div>
      <div class='line'>But in their stead, curses not loud but deep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mouth-honour, breath, which the poor heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Would fain deny, and dare not.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>We can conceive a common actor to play Richard tolerably well;
we can conceive no one to play Macbeth properly, or to look like
a man that had encountered the Weïrd Sisters. All the actors that
we have ever seen, appear as if they had encountered them on the
boards of Covent-garden or Drury-lane, but not on the heath at Fores,
and as if they did not believe what they had seen. The Witches of
<span class='sc'>Macbeth</span> indeed are ridiculous on the modern stage, and we doubt if
the Furies of Æschylus would be more respected. The progress of
manners and knowledge has an influence on the stage, and will in
time perhaps destroy both tragedy and comedy. Filch’s picking
pockets in the <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite> is not so good a jest as it used to be:
by the force of the police and of philosophy, Lillo’s murders and
the ghosts in Shakespear will become obsolete. At last, there will
be nothing left, good nor bad, to be desired or dreaded, on the theatre
or in real life.—A question has been started with respect to the
originality of Shakespear’s Witches, which has been well answered
by Mr. Lamb in his notes to the ‘Specimens of Early Dramatic
Poetry.’</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Though some resemblance may be traced between the charms in
<span class='sc'>Macbeth</span>, and the incantations in this play (the Witch of Middleton),
which is supposed to have preceded it, this coincidence will not detract
much from the originality of Shakespear. His Witches are distinguished
from the Witches of Middleton by essential differences. These are
creatures to whom man or woman plotting some dire mischief might resort
for occasional consultation. Those originate deeds of blood, and begin
bad impulses to men. From the moment that their eyes first meet with
Macbeth’s, he is spell-bound. That meeting sways his destiny. He can
never break the fascination. These Witches can hurt the body; those
have power over the soul.—Hecate in Middleton has a son, a low buffoon:
the hags of Shakespear have neither child of their own, nor seem to be
descended from any parent. They are foul anomalies, of whom we know
not whence they are sprung, nor whether they have beginning or ending.
As they are without human passions, so they seem to be without human
relations. They come with thunder and lightning, and vanish to airy
music. This is all we know of them.—Except Hecate, they have no
names, which heightens their mysteriousness. The names, and some of
the properties which Middleton has given to his hags, excite smiles. The
Weïrd Sisters are serious things. Their presence cannot co-exist with
mirth. But, in a lesser degree, the Witches of Middleton are fine creations.
Their power too is, in some measure, over the mind. They raise jars,
jealousies, strifes, <em>like a thick scurf o’er life</em>.’</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>JULIUS CÆSAR</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Julius Cæsar</span> was one of three principal plays by different authors,
pitched upon by the celebrated Earl of Hallifax to be brought out in
a splendid manner by subscription, in the year 1707. The other two
were the <cite>King and No King</cite> of Fletcher, and Dryden’s <cite>Maiden Queen</cite>.
There perhaps might be political reasons for this selection, as far as
regards our author. Otherwise, Shakespear’s <span class='sc'>Julius Cæsar</span> is not
equal as a whole, to either of his other plays taken from the Roman
history. It is inferior in interest to <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, and both in interest
and power to <cite>Antony and Cleopatra</cite>. It however abounds in admirable
and affecting passages, and is remarkable for the profound knowledge
of character, in which Shakespear could scarcely fail. If there is any
exception to this remark, it is in the hero of the piece himself. We
do not much admire the representation here given of Julius Cæsar,
nor do we think it answers to the portrait given of him in his
Commentaries. He makes several vapouring and rather pedantic
speeches, and does nothing. Indeed, he has nothing to do. So far,
the fault of the character is the fault of the plot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spirit with which the poet has entered at once into the
manners of the common people, and the jealousies and heart-burnings
of the different factions, is shown in the first scene, where Flavius
and Marullus, tribunes of the people, and some citizens of Rome,
appear upon the stage.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Flavius.</em> Thou art a cobler, art thou?</div>

<p class='c019'><em>Cobler.</em> Truly, Sir, <em>all</em> that I live by, is the <em>awl</em>. I meddle with no
tradesman’s matters, nor woman’s matters, but <em>with-al</em>, I am indeed, Sir, a

<p class='c019'><em>Cobler.</em> Truly, Sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more work.
But indeed, Sir, we make holiday to see Cæsar, and rejoice in his triumph.’</p>

<p class='c000'>To this specimen of quaint low humour immediately follows that
unexpected and animated burst of indignant eloquence, put into the
mouth of one of the angry tribunes.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The well-known dialogue between Brutus and Cassius, in which
the latter breaks the design of the conspiracy to the former, and
partly gains him over to it, is a noble piece of high-minded declamation.
Cassius’s insisting on the pretended effeminacy of Cæsar’s
character, and his description of their swimming across the Tiber
together, ‘once upon a raw and gusty day,’ are among the finest
strokes in it. But perhaps the whole is not equal to the short scene
which follows, when Cæsar enters with his train:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We know hardly any passage more expressive of the genius of
Shakespear than this. It is as if he had been actually present, had
known the different characters and what they thought of one another,
and had taken down what he heard and saw, their looks, words, and
gestures, just as they happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of Mark Antony is farther speculated upon where
the conspirators deliberate whether he shall fall with Cæsar. Brutus
is against it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And for Mark Antony, think not of him:</div>
      <div class='line'>For he can do no more than Cæsar’s arm,</div>
      <div class='line'>When Cæsar’s head is off.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Cassius.</em> Yet I do fear him:</div>
      <div class='line'>For in th’ ingrafted love he bears to Cæsar——</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Brutus.</em> Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</div>
      <div class='line'>If he love Cæsar, all that he can do</div>
      <div class='line'>Is to himself, take thought, and die for Cæsar:</div>
      <div class='line'>And that were much, he should; for he is giv’n</div>
      <div class='line'>To sports, to wildness, and much company.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Trebonius.</em> There is no fear in him; let him not die:</div>
      <div class='line'>For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>They were in the wrong; and Cassius was right.</p>

<p class='c000'>The honest manliness of Brutus is however sufficient to find out
the unfitness of Cicero to be included in their enterprise, from his
affected egotism and literary vanity.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘O, name him not: let us not break with him;</div>
      <div class='line'>For he will never follow anything,</div>
      <div class='line'>That other men begin.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>His scepticism as to prodigies and his moralising on the weather—‘This
disturbed sky is not to walk in’—are in the same spirit of
refined imbecility.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespear has in this play and elsewhere shown the same penetration
into political character and the springs of public events as into
those of every-day life. For instance, the whole design of the
conspirators to liberate their country fails from the generous temper
and overweening confidence of Brutus in the goodness of their cause
and the assistance of others. Thus it has always been. Those who
mean well themselves think well of others, and fall a prey to their
security. That humanity and honesty which dispose men to resist
injustice and tyranny render them unfit to cope with the cunning and
power of those who are opposed to them. The friends of liberty
trust to the professions of others, because they are themselves sincere,
and endeavour to reconcile the public good with the least possible
hurt to its enemies, who have no regard to any thing but their own
unprincipled ends, and stick at nothing to accomplish them. Cassius
was better cut out for a conspirator. His heart prompted his head.
His watchful jealousy made him fear the worst that might happen,
and his irritability of temper added to his inveteracy of purpose, and
sharpened his patriotism. The mixed nature of his motives made
him fitter to contend with bad men. The vices are never so well
employed as in combating one another. Tyranny and servility are to
be dealt with after their own fashion: otherwise, they will triumph
over those who spare them, and finally pronounce their funeral
panegyric, as Antony did that of Brutus.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘All the conspirators, save only he,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did that they did in envy of great Cæsar:</div>
      <div class='line'>He only in a general honest thought</div>
      <div class='line'>And common good to all, made one of them.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The quarrel between Brutus and Cassius is managed in a masterly
way. The dramatic fluctuation of passion, the calmness of Brutus,
the heat of Cassius, are admirably described; and the exclamation of
Cassius on hearing of the death of Portia, which he does not learn
till after their reconciliation, ‘How ‘scaped I killing when I crost you
so?’ gives double force to all that has gone before. The scene
between Brutus and Portia, where she endeavours to extort the secret
of the conspiracy from him, is conceived in the most heroical spirit,
and the burst of tenderness in Brutus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘You are my true and honourable wife;</div>
      <div class='line'>As dear to me as are the ruddy drops</div>
      <div class='line'>That visit my sad heart’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>is justified by her whole behaviour. Portia’s breathless impatience to
learn the event of the conspiracy, in the dialogue with Lucius, is full
of passion. The interest which Portia takes in Brutus and that
which Calphurnia takes in the fate of Cæsar are discriminated with
the nicest precision. Mark Antony’s speech over the dead body of
Cæsar has been justly admired for the mixture of pathos and artifice
in it: that of Brutus certainly is not so good.</p>

<p class='c000'>The entrance of the conspirators to the house of Brutus at midnight
is rendered very impressive. In the midst of this scene, we
meet with one of those careless and natural digressions which occur so
frequently and beautifully in Shakespear. After Cassius has introduced
his friends one by one, Brutus says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘They are all welcome.</div>
      <div class='line'>What watchful cares do interpose themselves</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt your eyes and night?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Cassius.</em> Shall I entreat a word?                 (<em>They whisper.</em>)</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Decius.</em> Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Casca.</em> No.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Cinna.</em> O pardon, Sir, it doth; and yon grey lines,</div>
      <div class='line'>That fret the clouds, are messengers of day.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Casca.</em> You shall confess, that you are both deceiv’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is a great way growing on the south,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weighing the youthful season of the year.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some two months hence, up higher toward the north</div>
      <div class='line'>He first presents his fire, and the high east</div>
      <div class='line'>Stands as the Capitol, directly here.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We cannot help thinking this graceful familiarity better than all the
fustian in the world.—The truth of history in <span class='sc'>Julius Cæsar</span> is very
ably worked up with dramatic effect. The councils of generals, the
doubtful turns of battles, are represented to the life. The death of
Brutus is worthy of him—it has the dignity of the Roman senator
with the firmness of the Stoic philosopher. But what is perhaps
better than either, is the little incident of his boy, Lucius, falling
asleep over his instrument, as he is playing to his master in his tent,
the night before the battle. Nature had played him the same forgetful
trick once before on the night of the conspiracy. The humanity of
Brutus is the same on both occasions.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>OTHELLO</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It has been said that tragedy purifies the affections by terror and
pity. That is, it substitutes imaginary sympathy for mere selfishness.
It gives us a high and permanent interest, beyond ourselves, in
humanity as such. It raises the great, the remote, and the possible
to an equality with the real, the little and the near. It makes man
a partaker with his kind. It subdues and softens the stubbornness of
his will. It teaches him that there are and have been others like
himself, by showing him as in a glass what they have felt, thought,
and done. It opens the chambers of the human heart. It leaves
nothing indifferent to us that can affect our common nature. It
excites our sensibility by exhibiting the passions wound up to the utmost
pitch by the power of imagination or the temptation of circumstances;
and corrects their fatal excesses in ourselves by pointing to the greater
extent of sufferings and of crimes to which they have led others.
Tragedy creates a balance of the affections. It makes us thoughtful
spectators in the lists of life. It is the refiner of the species; a
discipline of humanity. The habitual study of poetry and works of
imagination is one chief part of a well-grounded education. A taste
for liberal art is necessary to complete the character of a gentleman.
Science alone is hard and mechanical. It exercises the understanding
upon things out of ourselves, while it leaves the affections unemployed,
or engrossed with our own immediate, narrow interests.—<span class='sc'>Othello</span>
furnishes an illustration of these remarks. It excites our sympathy in
an extraordinary degree. The moral it conveys has a closer application
to the concerns of human life than that of almost any other of
Shakespear’s plays. ‘It comes directly home to the bosoms and
business of men.’ The pathos in <cite>Lear</cite> is indeed more dreadful and
overpowering: but it is less natural, and less of every day’s occurrence.
We have not the same degree of sympathy with the passions
described in <cite>Macbeth</cite>. The interest in <cite>Hamlet</cite> is more remote and
reflex. That of <span class='sc'>Othello</span> is at once equally profound and affecting.</p>

<p class='c000'>The picturesque contrasts of character in this play are almost as
remarkable as the depth of the passion. The Moor Othello, the
gentle Desdemona, the villain Iago, the good-natured Cassio, the fool
Roderigo, present a range and variety of character as striking and
palpable as that produced by the opposition of costume in a picture.
Their distinguishing qualities stand out to the mind’s eye, so that
even when we are not thinking of their actions or sentiments, the idea
of their persons is still as present to us as ever. These characters and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the images they stamp upon the mind are the farthest asunder possible,
the distance between them is immense: yet the compass of knowledge
and invention which the poet has shown in embodying these extreme
creations of his genius is only greater than the truth and felicity with
which he has identified each character with itself, or blended their
different qualities together in the same story. What a contrast the
character of Othello forms to that of Iago! At the same time, the
force of conception with which these two figures are opposed to each
other is rendered still more intense by the complete consistency with
which the traits of each character are brought out in a state of the
highest finishing. The making one black and the other white, the
one unprincipled, the other unfortunate in the extreme, would have
answered the common purposes of effect, and satisfied the ambition of
an ordinary painter of character. Shakespear has laboured the finer
shades of difference in both with as much care and skill as if he had
had to depend on the execution alone for the success of his design. On
the other hand, Desdemona and Æmilia are not meant to be opposed
with anything like strong contrast to each other. Both are, to outward
appearance, characters of common life, not more distinguished
than women usually are, by difference of rank and situation. The
difference of their thoughts and sentiments is however laid open, their
minds are separated from each other by signs as plain and as little to
be mistaken as the complexions of their husbands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The movement of the passion in Othello is exceedingly different
from that of Macbeth. In Macbeth there is a violent struggle
between opposite feelings, between ambition and the stings of conscience,
almost from first to last: in Othello, the doubtful conflict
between contrary passions, though dreadful, continues only for a short
time, and the chief interest is excited by the alternate ascendancy of
different passions, by the entire and unforeseen change from the
fondest love and most unbounded confidence to the tortures of jealousy
and the madness of hatred. The revenge of Othello, after it has
once taken thorough possession of his mind, never quits it, but grows
stronger and stronger at every moment of its delay. The nature of
the Moor is noble, confiding, tender, and generous; but his blood is
of the most inflammable kind; and being once roused by a sense of his
wrongs, he is stopped by no considerations of remorse or pity till he
has given a loose to all the dictates of his rage and his despair. It is
in working his noble nature up to this extremity through rapid but
gradual transitions, in raising passion to its height from the smallest
beginnings and in spite of all obstacles, in painting the expiring
conflict between love and hatred, tenderness and resentment, jealousy
and remorse, in unfolding the strength and the weakness of our nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>in uniting sublimity of thought with the anguish of the keenest woe,
in putting in motion the various impulses that agitate this our mortal
being, and at last blending them in that noble tide of deep and
sustained passion, impetuous but majestic, that ‘flows on to the
Propontic, and knows no ebb,’ that Shakespear has shown the mastery
of his genius and of his power over the human heart. The third act
of <span class='sc'>Othello</span> is his finest display, not of knowledge or passion separately,
but of the two combined, of the knowledge of character with the
expression of passion, of consummate art in the keeping up of appearances
with the profound workings of nature, and the convulsive movements
of uncontroulable agony, of the power of inflicting torture and
of suffering it. Not only is the tumult of passion in Othello’s mind
heaved up from the very bottom of the soul, but every the slightest
undulation of feeling is seen on the surface, as it arises from the
impulses of imagination or the malicious suggestions of Iago. The
progressive preparation for the catastrophe is wonderfully managed
from the Moor’s first gallant recital of the story of his love,
of ‘the spells and witchcraft he had used,’ from his unlooked-for and
romantic success, the fond satisfaction with which he dotes on his
own happiness, the unreserved tenderness of Desdemona and her
innocent importunities in favour of Cassio, irritating the suspicions
instilled into her husband’s mind by the perfidy of Iago, and rankling
there to poison, till he loses all command of himself, and his rage can
only be appeased by blood. She is introduced, just before Iago
begins to put his scheme in practice, pleading for Cassio with all
the thoughtless gaiety of friendship and winning confidence in the love
of Othello.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What! Michael Cassio?</div>
      <div class='line'>That came a wooing with you, and so many a time,</div>
      <div class='line'>When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath ta’en your part, to have so much to do</div>
      <div class='line'>To bring him in?—Why this is not a boon:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis as I should intreat you wear your gloves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or feed on nourishing meats, or keep you warm;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</div>
      <div class='line'>To your person. Nay, when I have a suit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</div>
      <div class='line'>It shall be full of poise, and fearful to be granted.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Othello’s confidence, at first only staggered by broken hints and
insinuations, recovers itself at sight of Desdemona; and he exclaims</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘If she be false, O then Heav’n mocks itself:</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll not believe it.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>But presently after, on brooding over his suspicions by himself, and
yielding to his apprehensions of the worst, his smothered jealousy
breaks out into open fury, and he returns to demand satisfaction of
Iago like a wild beast stung with the envenomed shaft of the hunters.
‘Look where he comes,’ etc. In this state of exasperation and
violence, after the first paroxysms of his grief and tenderness have had
their vent in that passionate apostrophe, ‘I felt not Cassio’s kisses on
her lips,’ Iago, by false aspersions, and by presenting the most
revolting images to his mind,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a> easily turns the storm of passion from
himself against Desdemona, and works him up into a trembling agony
of doubt and fear, in which he abandons all his love and hopes in
a breath.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago,</div>
      <div class='line'>All my fond love thus do I blow to Heav’n. ’Tis gone.</div>
      <div class='line'>Arise black vengeance from the hollow hell;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne</div>
      <div class='line'>To tyrannous hate! Swell bosom with thy fraught;</div>
      <div class='line'>For ’tis of aspicks’ tongues.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>From this time, his raging thoughts ‘never look back, ne’er ebb
to humble love,’ till his revenge is sure of its object, the painful
regrets and involuntary recollections of past circumstances which
cross his mind amidst the dim trances of passion, aggravating the
sense of his wrongs, but not shaking his purpose. Once indeed,
where Iago shows him Cassio with the handkerchief in his hand, and
making sport (as he thinks) of his misfortunes, the intolerable bitterness
of his feelings, the extreme sense of shame, makes him fall to
praising her accomplishments and relapse into a momentary fit of
weakness, ‘Yet, oh the pity of it, Iago, the pity of it!’ This
returning fondness however only serves, as it is managed by Iago,
to whet his revenge, and set his heart more against her. In his
conversations with Desdemona, the persuasion of her guilt and the
immediate proofs of her duplicity seem to irritate his resentment and
aversion to her; but in the scene immediately preceding her death,
the recollection of his love returns upon him in all its tenderness and
force; and after her death, he all at once forgets his wrongs in the
sudden and irreparable sense of his loss.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘My wife! My wife! What wife? I have no wife.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh insupportable! Oh heavy hour!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>This happens before he is assured of her innocence; but afterwards
his remorse is as dreadful as his revenge has been, and yields only to
fixed and death-like despair. His farewell speech, before he kills himself,
in which he conveys his reasons to the senate for the murder of
his wife, is equal to the first speech in which he gave them an account
of his courtship of her, and ‘his whole course of love.’ Such an
ending was alone worthy of such a commencement.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any thing could add to the force of our sympathy with Othello,
or compassion for his fate, it would be the frankness and generosity
of his nature, which so little deserve it. When Iago first begins to
practise upon his unsuspecting friendship, he answers—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——‘’Tis not to make me jealous,</div>
      <div class='line'>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where virtue is, these are most virtuous.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor from my own weak merits will I draw</div>
      <div class='line'>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,</div>
      <div class='line'>For she had eyes and chose me.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This character is beautifully (and with affecting simplicity) confirmed
by what Desdemona herself says of him to Æmilia after she has lost
the handkerchief, the first pledge of his love to her.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

<p class='c000'>In a short speech of Æmilia’s, there occurs one of those side-intimations
of the fluctuations of passion which we seldom meet with
but in Shakespear. After Othello has resolved upon the death of
his wife, and bids her dismiss her attendant for the night, she
answers,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I will, my Lord.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Æmilia.</em> How goes it now? <em>He looks gentler than he did.</em>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Shakespear has here put into half a line what some authors would
have spun out into ten set speeches.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of Desdemona is inimitable both in itself, and as it
appears in contrast with Othello’s groundless jealousy, and with the
foul conspiracy of which she is the innocent victim. Her beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>and external graces are only indirectly glanced at: we see ‘her
visage in her mind’; her character every where predominates over
her person.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A maiden never bold:</div>
      <div class='line'>Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion</div>
      <div class='line'>Blush’d at itself.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is one fine compliment paid to her by Cassio, who exclaims
triumphantly when she comes ashore at Cyprus after the storm,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,</div>
      <div class='line'>As having sense of beauty, do omit</div>
      <div class='line'>Their mortal natures, letting safe go by</div>
      <div class='line'>The divine Desdemona.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In general, as is the case with most of Shakespear’s females, we
lose sight of her personal charms in her attachment and devotedness
to her husband. ‘She is subdued even to the very quality of her
lord’; and to Othello’s ‘honours and his valiant parts her soul and
fortunes consecrates.’ The lady protests so much herself, and she
is as good as her word. The truth of conception, with which
timidity and boldness are united in the same character, is marvellous.
The extravagance of her resolutions, the pertinacity of her affections,
may be said to arise out of the gentleness of her nature. They
imply an unreserved reliance on the purity of her own intentions, an
entire surrender of her fears to her love, a knitting of herself (heart
and soul) to the fate of another. Bating the commencement of her
passion, which is a little fantastical and headstrong (though even that
may perhaps be consistently accounted for from her inability to resist
a rising inclination<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a>) her whole character consists in having no will
of her own, no prompter but her obedience. Her romantic turn is
only a consequence of the domestic and practical part of her disposition;
and instead of following Othello to the wars, she would gladly
have ‘remained at home a moth of peace,’ if her husband could have
staid with her. Her resignation and angelic sweetness of temper
do not desert her at the last. The scenes in which she laments and
tries to account for Othello’s estrangement from her are exquisitely
beautiful. After he has struck her, and called her names, she says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>——‘Alas, Iago,</div>
      <div class='line'>What shall I do to win my lord again?</div>
      <div class='line'>Good friend, go to him; for by this light of heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>If e’er my will did trespass ‘gainst his love,</div>

      <div class='line'>Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense</div>
      <div class='line'>Delighted them on any other form;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or that I do not, and ever did,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ever will, though he do shake me off</div>

      <div class='line'>Comfort forswear me. Unkindness may do much,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his unkindness may defeat my life,</div>
      <div class='line'>But never taint my love.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Iago.</em> I pray you be content: ’tis but his humour.</div>
      <div class='line'>The business of the state does him offence.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Desdemona.</em> If ‘twere no other!——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The scene which follows with Æmilia and the song of the
Willow, are equally beautiful, and show the author’s extreme power
of varying the expression of passion, in all its moods and in all
circumstances.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Æmilia.</em> Would you had never seen him.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Desdemona.</em> So would not I: my love doth so approve him,</div>
      <div class='line'>That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have grace and favour in them,’ etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Not the unjust suspicions of Othello, not Iago’s unprovoked treachery,
place Desdemona in a more amiable or interesting light than the
conversation (half earnest, half jest) between her and Æmilia on the
common behaviour of women to their husbands. This dialogue takes
place just before the last fatal scene. If Othello had overheard it,
it would have prevented the whole catastrophe; but then it would
have spoiled the play.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of Iago is one of the supererogations of Shakespear’s
genius. Some persons, more nice than wise, have thought this whole
character unnatural, because his villainy is <em>without a sufficient motive</em>.
Shakespear, who was as good a philosopher as he was a poet, thought
otherwise. He knew that the love of power, which is another name
for the love of mischief, is natural to man. He would know this as
well or better than if it had been demonstrated to him by a logical
diagram, merely from seeing children paddle in the dirt or kill flies
for sport. Iago in fact belongs to a class of character, common to
Shakespear and at the same time peculiar to him; whose heads are
as acute and active as their hearts are hard and callous. Iago is to
be sure an extreme instance of the kind; that is to say, of diseased
intellectual activity, with the most perfect indifference to moral good
or evil, or rather with a decided preference of the latter, because it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>falls more readily in with his favourite propensity, gives greater zest
to his thoughts and scope to his actions. He is quite or nearly as
indifferent to his own fate as to that of others; he runs all risks for
a trifling and doubtful advantage; and is himself the dupe and victim
of his ruling passion—an insatiable craving after action of the most
difficult and dangerous kind. ‘Our ancient’ is a philosopher, who
fancies that a lie that kills has more point in it than an alliteration or
an antithesis; who thinks a fatal experiment on the peace of a family
a better thing than watching the palpitations in the heart of a flea in
a microscope; who plots the ruin of his friends as an exercise for his
ingenuity, and stabs men in the dark to prevent <em>ennui</em>. His gaiety,
such as it is, arises from the success of his treachery; his ease from
the torture he has inflicted on others. He is an amateur of tragedy
in real life; and instead of employing his invention on imaginary
characters, or long-forgotten incidents, he takes the bolder and more
desperate course of getting up his plot at home, casts the principal
parts among his nearest friends and connections, and rehearses it in
downright earnest, with steady nerves and unabated resolution. We
will just give an illustration or two.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of his most characteristic speeches is that immediately after
the marriage of Othello.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Roderigo.</em> What a full fortune does the thick lips owe,</div>
      <div class='line'>If he can carry her thus!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Iago.</em> Call up her father:</div>
      <div class='line'>Rouse him (<cite>Othello</cite>) make after him, poison his delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tho’ he in a fertile climate dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Plague him with flies: tho’ that his joy be joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet throw such changes of vexation on it,</div>
      <div class='line'>As it may lose some colour.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the next passage, his imagination runs riot in the mischief he is
plotting, and breaks out into the wildness and impetuosity of real
enthusiasm.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Roderigo.</em> Here is her father’s house: I’ll call aloud.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Iago.</em> Do, with like timourous accent and dire yell</div>
      <div class='line'>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</div>
      <div class='line'>Is spied in populous cities.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>One of his most favourite topics, on which he is rich indeed, and
in descanting on which his spleen serves him for a Muse, is the disproportionate
match between Desdemona and the Moor. This is a
clue to the character of the lady which he is by no means ready to
part with. It is brought forward in the first scene, and he recurs to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>it, when in answer to his insinuations against Desdemona, Roderigo
says,</p>

<p class='c016'>‘I cannot believe that in her—she’s full of most blest conditions.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Iago.</em> Bless’d fig’s end. The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If
she had been blest, she would never have married the Moor.’</p>

<p class='c000'>And again with still more spirit and fatal effect afterwards, when he
turns this very suggestion arising in Othello’s own breast to her
prejudice.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Othello.</em> And yet how nature erring from itself—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Iago.</em> Ay, there’s the point;—as to be bold with you,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not to affect many proposed matches</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,’ etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This is probing to the quick. Iago here turns the character of
poor Desdemona, as it were, inside out. It is certain that nothing
but the genius of Shakespear could have preserved the entire interest
and delicacy of the part, and have even drawn an additional elegance
and dignity from the peculiar circumstances in which she is placed.—The
habitual licentiousness of Iago’s conversation is not to be traced
to the pleasure he takes in gross or lascivious images, but to his
desire of finding out the worst side of everything, and of proving
himself an over-match for appearances. He has none of ‘the milk
of human kindness’ in his composition. His imagination rejects
every thing that has not a strong infusion of the most unpalatable
ingredients; his mind digests only poisons. Virtue or goodness or
whatever has the least ‘relish of salvation in it,’ is, to his depraved
appetite, sickly and insipid: and he even resents the good opinion
entertained of his own integrity, as if it were an affront cast on the
masculine sense and spirit of his character. Thus at the meeting
between Othello and Desdemona, he exclaims—‘Oh, you are well
tuned now: but I’ll set down the pegs that make this music, <em>as
honest as I am</em>‘—his character of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhomme</span></i><a id='t208'></a> not sitting at all easy
upon him. In the scenes, where he tries to work Othello to his
purpose, he is proportionably guarded, insidious, dark, and deliberate.
We believe nothing ever came up to the profound dissimulation and
dextrous artifice of the well-known dialogue in the third act, where
he first enters upon the execution of his design.</p>

      <div class='line'>As if there was some monster in thy thought</div>
      <div class='line'>Too hideous to be shewn.’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The stops and breaks, the deep workings of treachery under the
mask of love and honesty, the anxious watchfulness, the cool earnestness,
and if we may so say, the <em>passion</em> of hypocrisy, marked in every
line, receive their last finishing in that inconceivable burst of pretended
indignation at Othello’s doubts of his sincerity.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘O grace! O Heaven forgive me!</div>
      <div class='line'>Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?</div>

      <div class='line'>I’ll love no friend, since love breeds such offence.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If Iago is detestable enough when he has business on his hands
and all his engines at work, he is still worse when he has nothing
to do, and we only see into the hollowness of his heart. His
indifference when Othello falls into a swoon, is perfectly diabolical.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The part indeed would hardly be tolerated, even as a foil to the
virtue and generosity of the other characters in the play, but for its
indefatigable industry and inexhaustible resources, which divert the
attention of the spectator (as well as his own) from the end he has
in view to the means by which it must be accomplished.—Edmund
the Bastard in <cite>Lear</cite> is something of the same character, placed in
less prominent circumstances. Zanga is a vulgar caricature of it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>TIMON OF ATHENS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Timon of Athens</span> always appeared to us to be written with as intense
a feeling of his subject as any one play of Shakespear. It is one of
the few in which he seems to be in earnest throughout, never to trifle
nor go out of his way. He does not relax in his efforts, nor lose
sight of the unity of his design. It is the only play of our author in
which spleen is the predominant feeling of the mind. It is as much
a satire as a play: and contains some of the finest pieces of invective
possible to be conceived, both in the snarling, captious answers of the
cynic Apemantus, and in the impassioned and more terrible imprecations
of Timon. The latter remind the classical reader of the force
and swelling impetuosity of the moral declamations in <em>Juvenal</em>, while
the former have all the keenness and caustic severity of the old Stoic
philosophers. The soul of Diogenes appears to have been seated on
the lips of Apemantus. The churlish profession of misanthropy in
the cynic is contrasted with the profound feeling of it in Timon, and
also with the soldier-like and determined resentment of Alcibiades
against his countrymen, who have banished him, though this forms
only an incidental episode in the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fable consists of a single event;—of the transition from the
highest pomp and profusion of artificial refinement to the most abject
state of savage life, and privation of all social intercourse. The
change is as rapid as it is complete; nor is the description of the rich
and generous Timon, banqueting in gilded palaces, pampered by every
luxury, prodigal of his hospitality, courted by crowds of flatterers,
poets, painters, lords, ladies, who—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear;</div>
      <div class='line'>And through him drink the free air’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>more striking than that of the sudden falling off of his friends and
fortune, and his naked exposure in a wild forest digging roots from
the earth for his sustenance, with a lofty spirit of self-denial, and
bitter scorn of the world, which raise him higher in our esteem than
the dazzling gloss of prosperity could do. He grudges himself the
means of life, and is only busy in preparing his grave. How forcibly
is the difference between what he was, and what he is, described in
Apemantus’s taunting questions, when he comes to reproach him with
the change in his way of life!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>——‘What, think’st thou,</div>
      <div class='line'>That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,</div>

      <div class='line'>And skip when thou point’st out? will the cold brook,</div>
      <div class='line'>Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste</div>

      <div class='line'>Answer mere nature, bid them flatter thee.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The manners are every where preserved with distinct truth. The
poet and painter are very skilfully played off against one another, both
affecting great attention to the other, and each taken up with his own
vanity, and the superiority of his own art. Shakespear has put into
the mouth of the former a very lively description of the genius of
poetry and of his own in particular.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——‘A thing slipt idly from me.</div>
      <div class='line'>Our poesy is as a gum, which issues</div>
      <div class='line'>From whence ’tis nourish’d. The fire i’ th’ flint</div>
      <div class='line'>Shews not till it be struck: our gentle flame</div>
      <div class='line'>Provokes itself—and like the current flies</div>
      <div class='line'>Each bound it chafes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The hollow friendship and shuffling evasions of the Athenian lords,
their smooth professions and pitiful ingratitude, are very satisfactorily
exposed, as well as the different disguises to which the meanness of
self-love resorts in such cases to hide a want of generosity and good
faith. The lurking selfishness of Apemantus does not pass undetected
amidst the grossness of his sarcasms and his contempt for the
pretensions of others. Even the two courtezans who accompany
Alcibiades to the cave of Timon are very characteristically sketched;
and the thieves who come to visit him are also ‘true men’ in their
way.—An exception to this general picture of selfish depravity is
found in the old and honest steward Flavius, to whom Timon pays
a full tribute of tenderness. Shakespear was unwilling to draw a
picture ‘<em>ugly all over with hypocrisy</em>.’ He owed this character to the
good-natured solicitations of his Muse. His mind might well have
been said to be the ‘sphere of humanity.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The moral sententiousness of this play equals that of Lord Bacon’s
Treatise on the Wisdom of the Ancients, and is indeed seasoned with
greater variety. Every topic of contempt or indignation is here
exhausted; but while the sordid licentiousness of Apemantus, which
turns every thing to gall and bitterness, shews only the natural virulence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>of his temper and antipathy to good or evil alike, Timon does
not utter an imprecation without betraying the extravagant workings
of disappointed passion, of love altered to hate. Apemantus sees
nothing good in any object, and exaggerates whatever is disgusting:
Timon is tormented with the perpetual contrast between things and
appearances, between the fresh, tempting outside and the rottenness
within, and invokes mischiefs on the heads of mankind proportioned
to the sense of his wrongs and of their treacheries. He impatiently
cries out, when he finds the gold,</p>

<p class='c000'>Timon is here just as ideal in his passion for ill as he had been
before in his belief of good, Apemantus was satisfied with the
mischief existing in the world, and with his own ill-nature. One
of the most decisive intimations of Timon’s morbid jealousy of
appearances is in his answer to Apemantus, who asks him,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What things in the world can’st thou nearest compare with thy flatterers?</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Apemantus, it is said, ‘loved few things better than to abhor himself.’
This is not the case with Timon, who neither loves to abhor
himself nor others. All his vehement misanthropy is forced, up-hill
work. From the slippery turns of fortune, from the turmoils of
passion and adversity, he wishes to sink into the quiet of the grave.
On that subject his thoughts are intent, on that he finds time and
place to grow romantic. He digs his own grave by the sea-shore;
contrives his funeral ceremonies amidst the pomp of desolation, and
builds his mausoleum of the elements.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>CORIOLANUS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Shakespear has in this play shewn himself well versed in history and
state-affairs. <span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span> is a storehouse of political common-places.
Any one who studies it may save himself the trouble of reading
Burke’s Reflections, or Paine’s Rights of Man, or the Debates in
both Houses of Parliament since the French Revolution or our own.
The arguments for and against aristocracy or democracy, on the
privileges of the few and the claims of the many, on liberty and
slavery, power and the abuse of it, peace and war, are here very ably
handled, with the spirit of a poet and the acuteness of a philosopher.
Shakespear himself seems to have had a leaning to the arbitrary side
of the question, perhaps from some feeling of contempt for his own
origin; and to have spared no occasion of baiting the rabble. What
he says of them is very true: what he says of their betters is also
very true, though he dwells less upon it.—The cause of the people
is indeed but little calculated as a subject for poetry: it admits of
rhetoric, which goes into argument and explanation, but it presents
no immediate or distinct images to the mind, ‘no jutting frieze,
buttress, or coigne of vantage’ for poetry ‘to make its pendant bed
and procreant cradle in.’ The language of poetry naturally falls in
with the language of power. The imagination is an exaggerating
and exclusive faculty: it takes from one thing to add to another:
it accumulates circumstances together to give the greatest possible
effect to a favourite object. The understanding is a dividing and
measuring faculty: it judges of things not according to their immediate
impression on the mind, but according to their relations to one
another. The one is a monopolising faculty, which seeks the greatest
quantity of present excitement by inequality and disproportion; the
other is a distributive faculty, which seeks the greatest quantity of
ultimate good, by justice and proportion. The one is an aristocratical,
the other a republican faculty. The principle of poetry is a
very anti-levelling principle. It aims at effect, it exists by contrast.
It admits of no medium. It is every thing by excess. It rises above
the ordinary standard of sufferings and crimes. It presents a dazzling
appearance. It shows its head turreted, crowned, and crested. Its
front is gilt and blood-stained. Before it ‘it carries noise, and behind
it leaves tears.’ It has its altars and its victims, sacrifices, human
sacrifices. Kings, priests, nobles, are its train-bearers, tyrants and
slaves its executioners.—‘Carnage is its daughter.’—Poetry is right-royal.
It puts the individual for the species, the one above the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>infinite many, might before right. A lion hunting a flock of sheep
or a herd of wild asses is a more poetical object than they; and we
even take part with the lordly beast, because our vanity or some other
feeling makes us disposed to place ourselves in the situation of the
strongest party. So we feel some concern for the poor citizens of
Rome when they meet together to compare their wants and grievances,
till Coriolanus comes in and with blows and big words drives
this set of ‘poor rats,’ this rascal scum, to their homes and beggary
before him. There is nothing heroical in a multitude of miserable
rogues not wishing to be starved, or complaining that they are like
to be so: but when a single man comes forward to brave their cries
and to make them submit to the last indignities, from mere pride and
self-will, our admiration of his prowess is immediately converted into
contempt for their pusillanimity. The insolence of power is stronger
than the plea of necessity. The tame submission to usurped authority
or even the natural resistance to it has nothing to excite or flatter
the imagination: it is the assumption of a right to insult or oppress
others that carries an imposing air of superiority with it. We had
rather be the oppressor than the oppressed. The love of power in
ourselves and the admiration of it in others are both natural to man:
the one makes him a tyrant, the other a slave. Wrong dressed out
in pride, pomp, and circumstance, has more attraction than abstract
right.—Coriolanus complains of the fickleness of the people: yet,
the instant he cannot gratify his pride and obstinacy at their expense,
he turns his arms against his country. If his country was not worth
defending, why did he build his pride on its defence? He is a conqueror
and a hero; he conquers other countries, and makes this a
plea for enslaving his own; and when he is prevented from doing so,
he leagues with its enemies to destroy his country. He rates the
people ‘as if he were a God to punish, and not a man of their infirmity.’
He scoffs at one of their tribunes for maintaining their
rights and franchises: ‘Mark you his absolute <em>shall</em>?’ not marking
his own absolute <em>will</em> to take every thing from them, his impatience
of the slightest opposition to his own pretensions being in proportion
to their arrogance and absurdity. If the great and powerful had the
beneficence and wisdom of Gods, then all this would have been well:
if with a greater knowledge of what is good for the people, they had
as great a care for their interest as they have themselves, if they were
seated above the world, sympathising with the welfare, but not feeling
the passions of men, receiving neither good nor hurt from them, but
bestowing their benefits as free gifts on them, they might then rule
over them like another Providence. But this is not the case.
Coriolanus is unwilling that the senate should shew their ‘cares’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>for the people, lest their ‘cares’ should be construed into ‘fears,’
to the subversion of all due authority; and he is no sooner disappointed
in his schemes to deprive the people not only of the cares
of the state, but of all power to redress themselves, than Volumnia
is made madly to exclaim,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,</div>
      <div class='line'>And occupations perish.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This is but natural: it is but natural for a mother to have more
regard for her son than for a whole city; but then the city should
be left to take some care of itself. The care of the state cannot, we
here see, be safely entrusted to maternal affection, or to the domestic
charities of high life. The great have private feelings of their own,
to which the interests of humanity and justice must courtesy. Their
interests are so far from being the same as those of the community,
that they are in direct and necessary opposition to them; their power
is at the expense of <em>our</em> weakness; their riches of <em>our</em> poverty; their
pride of <em>our</em> degradation; their splendour of <em>our</em> wretchedness; their
tyranny of <em>our</em> servitude. If they had the superior knowledge
ascribed to them (which they have not) it would only render them
so much more formidable; and from Gods would convert them into
Devils. The whole dramatic moral of <span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span> is that those who
have little shall have less, and that those who have much shall take
all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they
ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be
beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like
beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to
be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they
are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the
imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandize what excites
admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into
tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which
is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates
into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of
slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind
is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles
of <em>poetical justice</em>; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport
to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo
and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the
chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon
it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice
in reality.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most natural traits in this play is the difference of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>interest taken in the success of Coriolanus by his wife and mother.
The one is only anxious for his honour; the other is fearful for his
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she hears the trumpets that proclaim her son’s return, she

      <div class='line'>‘These are the ushers of Martius: before him</div>

      <div class='line'>Which being advanc’d, declines, and then men die.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Coriolanus himself is a complete character: his love of reputation,
his contempt of popular opinion, his pride and modesty, are consequences
of each other. His pride consists in the inflexible sternness
of his will; his love of glory is a determined desire to bear down all
opposition, and to extort the admiration both of friends and foes.
His contempt for popular favour, his unwillingness to hear his own
praises, spring from the same source. He cannot contradict the
praises that are bestowed upon him; therefore he is impatient at
hearing them. He would enforce the good opinion of others by his
actions, but does not want their acknowledgments in words.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Pray now, no more: my mother,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who has a charter to extol her blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>When she does praise me, grieves me.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>His magnanimity is of the same kind. He admires in an enemy
that courage which he honours in himself; he places himself on the
hearth of Aufidius with the same confidence that he would have met
him in the field, and feels that by putting himself in his power, he
takes from him all temptation for using it against him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>In the title-page of <span class='sc'>Coriolanus</span>, it is said at the bottom of the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dramatis Personæ</span></i>, ‘The whole history exactly followed, and many
of the principal speeches copied from the life of Coriolanus in Plutarch.’
It will be interesting to our readers to see how far this is
the case. Two of the principal scenes, those between Coriolanus and
Aufidius and between Coriolanus and his mother, are thus given in
Sir Thomas North’s Translation of Plutarch, dedicated to Queen
Elizabeth, 1579. The first is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c016'>‘It was even twilight when he entered the city of Antium, and many
people met him in the streets, but no man knew him. So he went directly
to Tullus Aufidius’ house, and when he came thither, he got him up
straight to the chimney-hearth, and sat him down, and spake not a word
to any man, his face all muffled over. They of the house spying him,
wondered what he should be, and yet they durst not bid him rise. For
ill-favouredly muffled and disguised as he was, yet there appeared a certain
majesty in his countenance and in his silence: whereupon they went to
Tullus, who was at supper, to tell him of the strange disguising of this
man. Tullus rose presently from the board, and coming towards him,
asked him what he was, and wherefore he came. Then Martius unmuffled
himself, and after he had paused awhile, making no answer, he said unto
himself, If thou knowest me not yet, Tullus, and seeing me, dost not perhaps
believe me to be the man I am indeed, I must of necessity discover
myself to be that I am. “I am Caius Martius, who hath done to thyself
particularly, and to all the Volces generally, great hurt and mischief, which
I cannot deny for my surname of Coriolanus that I bear. For I never had
other benefit nor recompence of the true and painful service I have done,
and the extreme dangers I have been in, but this only surname: a good
memory and witness of the malice and displeasure thou shouldest bear me.
Indeed the name only remaineth with me; for the rest, the envy and
cruelty of the people of Rome have taken from me, by the sufferance of
the dastardly nobility and magistrates, who have forsaken me, and let me
be banished by the people. This extremity hath now driven me to come
as a poor suitor, to take thy chimney-hearth, not of any hope I have to
save my life thereby. For if I had feared death, I would not have come
hither to put myself in hazard; but pricked forward with desire to be
revenged of them that thus have banished me, which now I do begin, in
putting my person into the hands of their enemies. Wherefore if thou
hast any heart to be wrecked of the injuries thy enemies have done thee,
speed thee now, and let my misery serve thy turn, and so use it as my
service may be a benefit to the Volces: promising thee, that I will fight
with better good will for all you, than I did when I was against you, knowing
that they fight more valiantly who know the force of the enemy, than
such as have never proved it. And if it be so that thou dare not, and
that thou art weary to prove fortune any more, then am I also weary to
live any longer. And it were no wisdom in thee to save the life of him
who hath been heretofore thy mortal enemy, and whose service now can
nothing help, nor pleasure thee.” Tullus hearing what he said, was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>marvellous glad man, and taking him by the hand, he said unto him:
“Stand up, O Martius, and be of good cheer, for in proffering thyself
unto us, thou doest us great honour: and by this means thou mayest hope
also of greater things at all the Volces’ hands.” So he feasted him for
that time, and entertained him in the honourablest manner he could, talking
with him of no other matter at that present: but within few days
after, they fell to consultation together in what sort they should begin
their wars.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The meeting between Coriolanus and his mother is also nearly
the same as in the play.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Now was Martius set then in the chair of state, with all the honours
of a general, and when he had spied the women coming afar off, he marvelled
what the matter meant: but afterwards knowing his wife which
came foremost, he determined at the first to persist in his obstinate and
inflexible rancour. But overcome in the end with natural affection, and
being altogether altered to see them, his heart would not serve him to tarry
their coming to his chair, but coming down in haste, he went to meet
them, and first he kissed his mother, and embraced her a pretty while,
then his wife and little children. And nature so wrought with him, that
the tears fell from his eyes, and he could not keep himself from making
much of them, but yielded to the affection of his blood, as if he had been
violently carried with the fury of a most swift-running stream. After
he had thus lovingly received them, and perceiving that his mother
Volumnia would begin to speak to him, he called the chiefest of the council
of the Volces to hear what she would say. Then she spake in this sort:
“If we held our peace, my son, and determined not to speak, the state of
our poor bodies, and present sight of our raiment, would easily betray to
thee what life we have led at home, since thy exile and abode abroad;
but think now with thyself, how much more unfortunate than all the
women living, we are come hither, considering that the sight which should
be most pleasant to all others to behold, spiteful fortune had made most
fearful to us: making myself to see my son, and my daughter here her
husband, besieging the walls of his native country: so as that which is
the only comfort to all others in their adversity and misery, to pray unto
the Gods, and to call to them for aid, is the only thing which plungeth
us into most deep perplexity. For we cannot, alas, together pray, both
for victory to our country, and for safety of thy life also: but a world of
grievous curses, yea more than any mortal enemy can heap upon us, are
forcibly wrapped up in our prayers. For the bitter sop of most hard choice
is offered thy wife and children, to forego one of the two: either to lose
the person of thyself, or the nurse of their native country. For myself, my
son, I am determined not to tarry till fortune in my lifetime do make an
end of this war. For if I cannot persuade thee rather to do good unto both
parties, than to overthrow and destroy the one, preferring love and nature
before the malice and calamity of wars, thou shalt see, my son, and trust
unto it, thou shalt no sooner march forward to assault thy country, but
thy foot shall tread upon thy mother’s womb, that brought thee first into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>this world. And I may not defer to see the day, either that my son be
led prisoner in triumph by his natural countrymen, or that he himself do
triumph of them, and of his natural country. For if it were so, that my
request tended to save thy country, in destroying the Volces, I must confess,
thou wouldest hardly and doubtfully resolve on that. For as to destroy
thy natural country, it is altogether unmeet and unlawful, so were it not
just and less honourable to betray those that put their trust in thee. But
my only demand consisteth, to make a goal delivery of all evils, which
delivereth equal benefit and safety, both to the one and the other, but
most honourable for the Volces. For it shall appear, that having victory
in their hands, they have of special favour granted us singular graces, peace
and amity, albeit themselves have no less part of both than we. Of which
good, if so it came to pass, thyself is the only author, and so hast thou the
only honour. But if it fail, and fall out contrary, thyself alone deservedly
shalt carry the shameful reproach and burthen of either party. So, though
the end of war be uncertain, yet this notwithstanding is most certain, that
if it be thy chance to conquer, this benefit shalt thou reap of thy goodly
conquest, to be chronicled the plague and destroyer of thy country. And
if fortune overthrow thee, then the world will say, that through desire to
revenge thy private injuries, thou hast for ever undone thy good friends,
who did most lovingly and courteously receive thee.” Martius gave good
ear unto his mother’s words, without interrupting her speech at all, and
after she had said what she would, he held his peace a pretty while, and
answered not a word. Hereupon she began again to speak unto him, and
said: “My son, why dost thou not answer me? Dost thou think it good
altogether to give place unto thy choler and desire of revenge, and thinkest
thou it not honesty for thee to grant thy mother’s request in so weighty
a cause? Dost thou take it honourable for a nobleman to remember the
wrongs and injuries done him, and dost not in like case think it an honest
nobleman’s part to be thankful for the goodness that parents do shew to
their children, acknowledging the duty and reverence they ought to bear
unto them? No man living is more bound to shew himself thankful in
all parts and respects than thyself; who so universally shewest all ingratitude.
Moreover, my son, thou hast sorely taken of thy country, exacting
grievous payments upon them, in revenge of the injuries offered thee;
besides, thou hast not hitherto shewed thy poor mother any courtesy.
And therefore, it is not only honest but due unto me, that without compulsion
I should obtain my so just and reasonable request of thee. But
since by reason I cannot persuade thee to it, to what purpose do I defer my
last hope.” And with these words, herself, his wife and children, fell
down upon their knees before him: Martius seeing that, could refrain no
longer, but went straight and lifted her up, crying out, “Oh mother, what
have you done to me?” And holding her hard by the hand, “Oh
mother,” said he, “you have won a happy victory for your country, but
mortal and unhappy for your son: for I see myself vanquished by you
alone.” These words being spoken openly, he spake a little apart with his
mother and wife, and then let them return again to Rome, for so they did
request him; and so remaining in the camp that night, the next morning
he dislodged, and marched homeward unto the Volces’ country again.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Shakespear has, in giving a dramatic form to this passage, adhered
very closely and properly to the text. He did not think it necessary
to improve upon the truth of nature. Several of the scenes in <cite>Julius
Cæsar</cite>, particularly Portia’s appeal to the confidence of her husband
by shewing him the wound she had given herself, and the appearance
of the ghost of Cæsar to Brutus, are in like manner, taken from the
history.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>TROILUS AND CRESSIDA</h3>

<p class='c011'>This is one of the most loose and desultory of our author’s plays: it
rambles on just as it happens, but it overtakes, together with some
indifferent matter, a prodigious number of fine things in its way.
Troilus himself is no character: he is merely a common lover: but
Cressida and her uncle Pandarus are hit off with proverbial truth.
By the speeches given to the leaders of the Grecian host, Nestor,
Ulysses, Agamemnon, Achilles, Shakespear seems to have known
them as well as if he had been a spy sent by the Trojans into the
enemy’s camp—to say nothing of their affording very lofty examples
of didactic eloquence. The following is a very stately and spirited
declamation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Ulysses.</em> Troy, yet upon her basis, had been down,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the great Hector’s sword had lack’d a master,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for these instances.</div>
      <div class='line'>The specialty of rule hath been neglected.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center,</div>
      <div class='line'>Observe degree, priority, and place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</div>
      <div class='line'>Office, and custom, in all line of order:</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore is the glorious planet, Sol,</div>
      <div class='line'>In noble eminence, enthron’d and spher’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Amidst the other, whose med’cinable eye</div>
      <div class='line'>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,</div>
      <div class='line'>And posts, like the commandment of a king,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sans check, to good and bad. But, when the planets,</div>
      <div class='line'>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</div>
      <div class='line'>What plagues, and what portents? what mutinies?</div>
      <div class='line'>What raging of the sea? shaking of the earth?</div>
      <div class='line'>Commotion in the winds? frights, changes, horrors,</div>
      <div class='line'>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</div>
      <div class='line'>The unity and married calm of states</div>
      <div class='line'>Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shaken,</div>
      <div class='line'>(Which is the ladder to all high designs)</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>The enterprize is sick! How could communities,</div>
      <div class='line'>Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,</div>
      <div class='line'>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</div>
      <div class='line'>The primogenitive and due of birth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</div>
      <div class='line'>(But by degree) stand in authentic place?</div>
      <div class='line'>Take but degree away, untune that string,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hark what discord follows! each thing meets</div>
      <div class='line'>In mere oppugnancy. The bounded waters</div>
      <div class='line'>Would lift their bosoms higher than the shores,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make a sop of all this solid globe:</div>
      <div class='line'>Strength would be the lord of imbecility,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the rude son would strike his father dead:</div>
      <div class='line'>Force would be right; or rather right and wrong</div>
      <div class='line'>(Between whose endless jar Justice resides)</div>
      <div class='line'>Would lose their names, and so would Justice too.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then every thing includes itself in power,</div>
      <div class='line'>Power into will, will into appetite;</div>
      <div class='line'>And appetite (an universal wolf,</div>
      <div class='line'>So doubly seconded with will and power)</div>
      <div class='line'>Must make perforce an universal prey,</div>
      <div class='line'>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</div>
      <div class='line'>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Follows the choking:</div>
      <div class='line'>And this neglection of degree it is,</div>
      <div class='line'>That by a pace goes backward, in a purpose</div>
      <div class='line'>It hath to climb. The general’s disdained</div>
      <div class='line'>By him one step below; he, by the next;</div>
      <div class='line'>That next, by him beneath: so every step,</div>
      <div class='line'>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</div>
      <div class='line'>Of pale and bloodless emulation;</div>
      <div class='line'>And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</div>
      <div class='line'>Troy in our weakness lives, not in her strength.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It cannot be said of Shakespear, as was said of some one, that he
was ‘without o’erflowing full.’ He was full, even to o’erflowing.
He gave heaped measure, running over. This was his greatest fault.
He was only in danger ‘of losing distinction in his thoughts’ (to
borrow his own expression)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘As doth a battle when they charge on heaps</div>
      <div class='line'>The enemy flying.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is another passage, the speech of Ulysses to Achilles, shewing
him the thankless nature of popularity, which has a still greater depth
of moral observation and richness of illustration than the former. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>is long, but worth the quoting. The sometimes giving an entire
argument from the unacted plays of our author may with one class of
readers have almost the use of restoring a lost passage; and may
serve to convince another class of critics, that the poet’s genius was
not confined to the production of stage effect by preternatural means.—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Ulysses.</em> Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,</div>

      <div class='line'>For Time is like a fashionable host,</div>
      <div class='line'>That slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with his arms outstretch’d, as he would fly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grasps in the comer: the welcome ever smiles,</div>
      <div class='line'>And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek</div>
      <div class='line'>Remuneration for the thing it was; for beauty, wit,</div>
      <div class='line'>High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,</div>
      <div class='line'>Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all</div>
      <div class='line'>To envious and calumniating time:</div>
      <div class='line'>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.</div>
      <div class='line'>That all with one consent praise new-born gauds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tho’ they are made and moulded of things past.</div>
      <div class='line'>The present eye praises the present object.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,</div>
      <div class='line'>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;</div>
      <div class='line'>Since things in motion sooner catch the eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than what not stirs. The cry went out on thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still it might, and yet it may again,</div>
      <div class='line'>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive,</div>
      <div class='line'>And case thy reputation in thy tent.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The throng of images in the above lines is prodigious; and though
they sometimes jostle against one another, they every where raise and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>carry on the feeling, which is intrinsically true and profound. The
debates between the Trojan chiefs on the restoring of Helen are full
of knowledge of human motives and character. Troilus enters well
into the philosophy of war, when he says in answer to something that
falls from Hector,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Why there you touch’d the life of our design:</div>
      <div class='line'>Were it not glory that we more affected,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than the performance of our heaving spleens,</div>
      <div class='line'>I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood</div>
      <div class='line'>Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,</div>
      <div class='line'>She is a theme of honour and renown,</div>
      <div class='line'>A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The character of Hector, in a few slight indications which appear
of it, is made very amiable. His death is sublime, and shews in a
striking light the mixture of barbarity and heroism of the age. The
threats of Achilles are fatal; they carry their own means of execution
with them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Come here about me, you my myrmidons,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mark what I say.—Attend me where I wheel:</div>
      <div class='line'>Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when I have the bloody Hector found,</div>
      <div class='line'>Empale him with your weapons round about,</div>
      <div class='line'>In fellest manner execute your arms.</div>
      <div class='line'>Follow me, sirs, and my proceeding eye.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He then finds Hector and slays him, as if he had been hunting
down a wild beast. There is something revolting as well as terrific
in the ferocious coolness with which he singles out his prey: nor
does the splendour of the achievement reconcile us to the cruelty of
the means.</p>

<p class='c000'>The characters of Cressida and Pandarus are very amusing and
instructive. The disinterested willingness of Pandarus to serve his
friend in an affair which lies next his heart is immediately brought
forward. ‘Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way; had I a sister were
a grace, or a daughter were a goddess, he should take his choice.
O admirable man! Paris, Paris is dirt to him, and I warrant Helen,
to change, would give money to boot.’ This is the language he
addresses to his niece: nor is she much behindhand in coming into
the plot. Her head is as light and fluttering as her heart. ‘It is
the prettiest villain, she fetches her breath so short as a new-ta’en
sparrow.’ Both characters are originals, and quite different from
what they are in Chaucer. In Chaucer, Cressida is represented as
a grave, sober, considerate personage (a widow—he cannot tell her
age, nor whether she has children or no) who has an alternate eye to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>her character, her interest, and her pleasure: Shakespear’s Cressida
is a giddy girl, an unpractised jilt, who falls in love with Troilus, as
she afterwards deserts him, from mere levity and thoughtlessness of
temper. She may be wooed and won to any thing and from any thing,
at a moment’s warning; the other knows very well what she would
be at, and sticks to it, and is more governed by substantial reasons
than by caprice or vanity. Pandarus again, in Chaucer’s story, is a
friendly sort of go-between, tolerably busy, officious, and forward in
bringing matters to bear: but in Shakespear he has ‘a stamp exclusive
and professional’: he wears the badge of his trade; he is a regular
knight of the game. The difference of the manner in which the
subject is treated arises perhaps less from intention, than from the
different genius of the two poets. There is no <em>double entendre</em> in the
characters of Chaucer: they are either quite serious or quite comic.
In Shakespear the ludicrous and ironical are constantly blended with
the stately and the impassioned. We see Chaucer’s characters as
they saw themselves, not as they appeared to others or might have
appeared to the poet. He is as deeply implicated in the affairs of his
personages as they could be themselves. He had to go a long journey
with each of them, and became a kind of necessary confidant. There
is little relief, or light and shade in his pictures. The conscious
smile is not seen lurking under the brow of grief or impatience.
Every thing with him is intense and continuous—a working out of
what went before.—Shakespear never committed himself to his
characters. He trifled, laughed, or wept with them as he chose.
He has no prejudices for or against them; and it seems a matter of
perfect indifference whether he shall be in jest or earnest. According
to him ‘the web of our lives is of a mingled yarn, good and ill
together.’ His genius was dramatic, as Chaucer’s was historical.
He saw both sides of a question, the different views taken of it
according to the different interests of the parties concerned, and he
was at once an actor and spectator in the scene. If any thing, he is
too various and flexible: too full of transitions, of glancing lights, of
salient points. If Chaucer followed up his subject too doggedly,
perhaps Shakespear was too volatile and heedless. The Muse’s
wing too often lifted him from off his feet. He made infinite
excursions to the right and the left.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——‘He hath done</div>
      <div class='line'>Mad and fantastic execution,</div>
      <div class='line'>Engaging and redeeming of himself</div>
      <div class='line'>With such a careless force and forceless care,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if that luck in very spite of cunning</div>
      <div class='line'>Bad him win all.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Chaucer attended chiefly to the real and natural, that is, to the
involuntary and inevitable impressions on the mind in given circumstances;
Shakespear exhibited also the possible and the fantastical,—not
only what things are in themselves, but whatever they might seem
to be, their different reflections, their endless combinations. He lent
his fancy, wit, invention, to others, and borrowed their feelings in
return. Chaucer excelled in the force of habitual sentiment; Shakespear
added to it every variety of passion, every suggestion of thought
or accident. Chaucer described external objects with the eye of a
painter, or he might be said to have embodied them with the hand
of a sculptor, every part is so thoroughly made out, and tangible:—Shakespear’s
imagination threw over them a lustre</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—‘Prouder than when blue Iris bends.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Every thing in Chaucer has a downright reality. A simile or a
sentiment is as if it were given in upon evidence. In Shakespear the
commonest matter-of-fact has a romantic grace about it; or seems to
float with the breath of imagination in a freer element. No one
could have more depth of feeling or observation than Chaucer, but
he wanted resources of invention to lay open the stores of nature or
the human heart with the same radiant light that Shakespear has
done. However fine or profound the thought, we know what is
coming, whereas the effect of reading Shakespear is ‘like the eye of
vassalage at unawares encountering majesty.’ Chaucer’s mind was
consecutive, rather than discursive. He arrived at truth through a
certain process; Shakespear saw every thing by intuition. Chaucer
had a great variety of power, but he could do only one thing at once.
He set himself to work on a particular subject. His ideas were kept
separate, labelled, ticketed and parcelled out in a set form, in pews
and compartments by themselves. They did not play into one
another’s hands. They did not re-act upon one another, as the
blower’s breath moulds the yielding glass. There is something hard
and dry in them. What is the most wonderful thing in Shakespear’s
faculties is their excessive sociability, and how they gossiped and
compared notes together.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must conclude this criticism; and we will do it with a quotation
or two. One of the most beautiful passages in Chaucer’s tale is
the description of Cresseide’s first avowal of her love.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And as the new abashed nightingale,</div>
      <div class='line'>That stinteth first when she beginneth sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>When that she heareth any herde’s tale,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or in the hedges any wight stirring,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, after, sicker doth her voice outring;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Right so Cresseide, when that her dread stent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Opened her heart, and told him her intent.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>See also the two next stanzas, and particularly that divine one
beginning—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Her armes small, her back both straight and soft,’ etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Compare this with the following speech of Troilus to Cressida in
the play:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘O, that I thought it could be in a woman;</div>
      <div class='line'>And if it can, I will presume in you,</div>
      <div class='line'>To feed for aye her lamp and flame of love,</div>
      <div class='line'>To keep her constancy in plight and youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out-living beauties outward, with a mind</div>
      <div class='line'>That doth renew swifter than blood decays.</div>
      <div class='line'>Or, that persuasion could but thus convince me,</div>
      <div class='line'>That my integrity and truth to you</div>
      <div class='line'>Might be affronted with the match and weight</div>
      <div class='line'>Of such a winnow’d purity in love;</div>
      <div class='line'>How were I then uplifted! But alas,</div>
      <div class='line'>I am as true as Truth’s simplicity,</div>
      <div class='line'>And simpler than the infancy of Truth.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These passages may not seem very characteristic at first sight,
though we think they are so. We will give two, that cannot be
mistaken. Patroclus says to Achilles,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>——‘Rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And like a dew-drop from the lion’s mane,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be shook to air.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Troilus, addressing the God of Day on the approach of the
morning that parts him from Cressida, says with much scorn,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What! proffer’st thou thy light here for to sell?</div>
      <div class='line'>Go sell it them that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">smallé selés grave</span>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If nobody but Shakespear could have written the former, nobody
but Chaucer would have thought of the latter.—Chaucer was the
most literal of poets, as Richardson was of prose-writers.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This is a very noble play. Though not in the first class of Shakespear’s
productions, it stands next to them, and is, we think, the finest
of his historical plays, that is, of those in which he made poetry the
organ of history, and assumed a certain tone of character and sentiment,
in conformity to known facts, instead of trusting to his observations
of general nature or to the unlimited indulgence of his own
fancy. What he has added to the actual story, is upon a par with
it. His genius was, as it were, a match for history as well as nature,
and could grapple at will with either. The play is full of that
pervading comprehensive power by which the poet could always make
himself master of time and circumstances. It presents a fine picture
of Roman pride and Eastern magnificence: and in the struggle
between the two, the empire of the world seems suspended, ‘like the
swan’s down-feather,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That stands upon the swell at full of tide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And neither way inclines.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The characters breathe, move, and live. Shakespear does not stand
reasoning on what his characters would do or say, but at once <em>becomes</em>
them, and speaks and acts for them. He does not present us with
groups of stage-puppets or poetical machines making set speeches on
human life, and acting from a calculation of problematical motives,
but he brings living men and women on the scene, who speak and
act from real feelings, according to the ebbs and flows of passion,
without the least tincture of pedantry of logic or rhetoric. Nothing
is made out by inference and analogy, by climax and antithesis, but
every thing takes place just as it would have done in reality, according
to the occasion.—The character of Cleopatra is a master-piece.
What an extreme contrast it affords to Imogen! One would think
it almost impossible for the same person to have drawn both. She
is voluptuous, ostentatious, conscious, boastful of her charms, haughty,
tyrannical, fickle. The luxurious pomp and gorgeous extravagance
of the Egyptian queen are displayed in all their force and lustre, as
well as the irregular grandeur of the soul of Mark Antony. Take

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The barge she sat in, like a burnish’d throne,</div>
      <div class='line'>Burnt on the water; the poop was beaten gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that</div>
      <div class='line'>The winds were love-sick’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>seems to prepare the way for, and almost to justify the subsequent
infatuation of Antony when in the sea-fight at Actium, he leaves the
battle, and ‘like a doating mallard’ follows her flying sails.</p>

<p class='c000'>Few things in Shakespear (and we know of nothing in any other
author like them) have more of that local truth of imagination and
character than the passage in which Cleopatra is represented conjecturing
what were the employments of Antony in his absence—‘He’s
speaking now, or murmuring—<em>Where’s my serpent of old Nile?</em>’
Or again, when she says to Antony, after the defeat at Actium, and
his summoning up resolution to risk another fight—‘It is my birthday;
I had thought to have held it poor; but since my lord is
Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.’ Perhaps the finest burst of all
is Antony’s rage after his final defeat when he comes in, and surprises
the messenger of Cæsar kissing her hand—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To let a fellow that will take rewards,</div>
      <div class='line'>And say God quit you, be familiar with,</div>
      <div class='line'>My play-fellow, your hand; this kingly seal,</div>
      <div class='line'>And plighter of high hearts.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is no wonder that he orders him to be whipped; but his low
condition is not the true reason: there is another feeling which lies
deeper, though Antony’s pride would not let him shew it, except by
his rage; he suspects the fellow to be Cæsar’s proxy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cleopatra’s whole character is the triumph of the voluptuous, of
the love of pleasure and the power of giving it, over every other
consideration. Octavia is a dull foil to her, and Fulvia a shrew and
shrill-tongued. What a picture do those lines give of her—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>What a spirit and fire in her conversation with Antony’s messenger
who brings her the unwelcome news of his marriage with Octavia!

promised reward to him—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>She had great and unpardonable faults, but the grandeur of her
death almost redeems them. She learns from the depth of despair
the strength of her affections. She keeps her queen-like state in the
last disgrace, and her sense of the pleasurable in the last moments of
her life. She tastes a luxury in death. After applying the asp, she
says with fondness—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is worth while to observe that Shakespear has contrasted the
extreme magnificence of the descriptions in this play with pictures
of extreme suffering and physical horror, not less striking—partly
perhaps to place the effeminate character of Mark Antony in a more
favourable light, and at the same time to preserve a certain balance
of feeling in the mind. Cæsar says, hearing of his rival’s conduct

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>is one of those fine retrospections which show us the winding and
eventful march of human life. The jealous attention which has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>paid to the unities both of time and place has taken away the principle
of perspective in the drama, and all the interest which objects derive
from distance, from contrast, from privation, from change of fortune,
from long-cherished passion; and contrasts our view of life from a
strange and romantic dream, long, obscure, and infinite, into a smartly
contested, three hours’ inaugural disputation on its merits by the
different candidates for theatrical applause.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latter scenes of <span class='sc'>Antony and Cleopatra</span> are full of the changes
of accident and passion. Success and defeat follow one another with
startling rapidity. Fortune sits upon her wheel more blind and giddy
than usual. This precarious state and the approaching dissolution of
his greatness are strikingly displayed in the dialogue of Antony with
Eros.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This is, without doubt, one of the finest pieces of poetry in Shakespear.
The splendour of the imagery, the semblance of reality, the
lofty range of picturesque objects hanging over the world, their
evanescent nature, the total uncertainty of what is left behind, are
just like the mouldering schemes of human greatness. It is finer than
Cleopatra’s passionate lamentation over his fallen grandeur, because it
is more dim, unstable, unsubstantial. Antony’s headstrong presumption
and infatuated determination to yield to Cleopatra’s wishes to
fight by sea instead of land, meet a merited punishment; and the
extravagance of his resolutions, increasing with the desperateness of
his circumstances, is well commented upon by Œnobarbus.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>The repentance of Œnobarbus after his treachery to his master
is the most affecting part of the play. He cannot recover from the
blow which Antony’s generosity gives him, and he dies broken-hearted,
‘a master-leaver and a fugitive.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespear’s genius has spread over the whole play a richness like
the overflowing of the Nile.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>HAMLET</h3>

<p class='c011'>This is that Hamlet the Dane, whom we read of in our youth, and
whom we may be said almost to remember in our after-years; he
who made that famous soliloquy on life, who gave the advice to the
players, who thought ‘this goodly frame, the earth, a steril promontory,
and this brave o’er-hanging firmament, the air, this majestical
roof fretted with golden fire, a foul and pestilent congregation of
vapours’; whom ‘man delighted not, nor woman neither’; he who
talked with the grave-diggers, and moralised on Yorick’s skull; the
school-fellow of Rosencraus and Guildenstern at Wittenberg; the
friend of Horatio; the lover of Ophelia; he that was mad and sent
to England; the slow avenger of his father’s death; who lived at
the court of Horwendillus five hundred years before we were born,
but all whose thoughts we seem to know as well as we do our own,
because we have read them in Shakespear.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage
of the poet’s brain. What then, are they not real? They are as
real as our own thoughts. Their reality is in the reader’s mind. It
is <em>we</em> who are Hamlet. This play has a prophetic truth, which is
above that of history. Whoever has become thoughtful and melancholy
through his own mishaps or those of others; whoever has
borne about with him the clouded brow of reflection, and thought
himself ‘too much i’ th’ sun’; whoever has seen the golden lamp
of day dimmed by envious mists rising in his own breast, and could
find in the world before him only a dull blank with nothing left
remarkable in it; whoever has known ‘the pangs of despised love,
the insolence of office, or the spurns which patient merit of the
unworthy takes’; he who has felt his mind sink within him, and
sadness cling to his heart like a malady, who has had his hopes
blighted and his youth staggered by the apparitions of strange things;
who cannot be well at ease, while he sees evil hovering near him like
a spectre; whose powers of action have been eaten up by thought,
he to whom the universe seems infinite, and himself nothing; whose
bitterness of soul makes him careless of consequences, and who goes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>a play as his best resource to shove off, to a second remove, the evils
of life by a mock representation of them—this is the true Hamlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have been so used to this tragedy that we hardly know how
to criticise it any more than we should know how to describe our
own faces. But we must make such observations as we can. It is
the one of Shakespear’s plays that we think of the oftenest, because
it abounds most in striking reflections on human life, and because the
distresses of Hamlet are transferred, by the turn of his mind, to the
general account of humanity. Whatever happens to him we apply to
ourselves, because he applies it so himself as a means of general reasoning.
He is a great moraliser; and what makes him worth attending
to is, that he moralises on his own feelings and experience. He is
not a common-place pedant. If <cite>Lear</cite> is distinguished by the greatest
depth of passion, <span class='sc'>Hamlet</span> is the most remarkable for the ingenuity,
originality, and unstudied developement of character. Shakespear had
more magnanimity than any other poet, and he has shewn more of it
in this play than in any other. There is no attempt to force an
interest: every thing is left for time and circumstances to unfold.
The attention is excited without effort, the incidents succeed each
other as matters of course, the characters think and speak and act
just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. There is no set
purpose, no straining at a point. The observations are suggested by
the passing scene—the gusts of passion come and go like sounds of
music borne on the wind. The whole play is an exact transcript
of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of
Denmark, at the remote period of time fixed upon, before the modern
refinements in morals and manners were heard of. It would have
been interesting enough to have been admitted as a by-stander in such
a scene, at such a time, to have heard and witnessed something of
what was going on. But here we are more than spectators. We
have not only ‘the outward pageants and the signs of grief’; but
‘we have that within which passes shew.’ We read the thoughts of
the heart, we catch the passions living as they rise. Other dramatic
writers give us very fine versions and paraphrases of nature; but
Shakespear, together with his own comments, gives us the original
text, that we may judge for ourselves. This is a very great advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of Hamlet stands quite by itself. It is not a
character marked by strength of will or even of passion, but by
refinement of thought and sentiment. Hamlet is as little of the hero
as a man can well be: but he is a young and princely novice, full of
high enthusiasm and quick sensibility—the sport of circumstances,
questioning with fortune and refining on his own feelings, and forced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>from the natural bias of his disposition by the strangeness of his
situation. He seems incapable of deliberate action, and is only
hurried into extremities on the spur of the occasion, when he has no
time to reflect, as in the scene where he kills Polonius, and again,
where he alters the letters which Rosencraus and Guildenstern are
taking with them to England, purporting his death. At other times,
when he is most bound to act, he remains puzzled, undecided, and
sceptical, dallies with his purposes, till the occasion is lost, and finds
out some pretence to relapse into indolence and thoughtfulness again.
For this reason he refuses to kill the King when he is at his prayers,
and by a refinement in malice, which is in truth only an excuse for
his own want of resolution, defers his revenge to a more fatal opportunity,
when he shall be engaged in some act ‘that has no relish of
salvation in it.’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘He kneels and prays,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now I’ll do’t, and so he goes to heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so am I reveng’d: <em>that would be scann’d</em>.</div>
      <div class='line'>He kill’d my father, and for that,</div>
      <div class='line'>I, his sole son, send him to heaven.</div>
      <div class='line'>Why this is reward, not revenge.</div>
      <div class='line'>Up sword and know thou a more horrid time,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he is drunk, asleep, or in a rage.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He is the prince of philosophical speculators; and because he
cannot have his revenge perfect, according to the most refined idea
his wish can form, he declines it altogether. So he scruples to trust
the suggestions of the ghost, contrives the scene of the play to have
surer proof of his uncle’s guilt, and then rests satisfied with this confirmation
of his suspicions, and the success of his experiment, instead
of acting upon it. Yet he is sensible of his own weakness, taxes
himself with it, and tries to reason himself out of it.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘How all occasions do inform against me,</div>

      <div class='line'>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</div>
      <div class='line'>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</div>
      <div class='line'>To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even for an egg-shell. ’Tis not to be great</div>
      <div class='line'>Never to stir without great argument;</div>
      <div class='line'>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw,</div>
      <div class='line'>When honour’s at the stake. How stand I then,</div>
      <div class='line'>That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And let all sleep, while to my shame I see</div>
      <div class='line'>The imminent death of twenty thousand men,</div>
      <div class='line'>That for a fantasy and trick of fame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is not tomb enough and continent</div>
      <div class='line'>To hide the slain?—O, from this time forth,</div>
      <div class='line'>My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Still he does nothing; and this very speculation on his own infirmity
only affords him another occasion for indulging it. It is not from
any want of attachment to his father or of abhorrence of his murder
that Hamlet is thus dilatory, but it is more to his taste to indulge
his imagination in reflecting upon the enormity of the crime and
refining on his schemes of vengeance, than to put them into immediate
practice. His ruling passion is to think, not to act: and any vague
pretext that flatters this propensity instantly diverts him from his
previous purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The moral perfection of this character has been called in question,
we think, by those who did not understand it. It is more interesting
than according to rules; amiable, though not faultless. The ethical
delineations of ‘that noble and liberal casuist’ (as Shakespear has
been well called) do not exhibit the drab-coloured Quakerism of
morality. His plays are not copied either from The Whole Duty
of Man, or from The Academy of Compliments! We confess we
are a little shocked at the want of refinement in those who are
shocked at the want of refinement in Hamlet. The neglect of
punctilious exactness in his behaviour either partakes of the ‘licence
of the time,’ or else belongs to the very excess of intellectual refinement
in the character, which makes the common rules of life, as well
as his own purposes, sit loose upon him. He may be said to be
amenable only to the tribunal of his own thoughts, and is too much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>taken up with the airy world of contemplation to lay as much stress
as he ought on the practical consequences of things. His habitual
principles of action are unhinged and out of joint with the time.
His conduct to Ophelia is quite natural in his circumstances. It is
that of assumed severity only. It is the effect of disappointed hope,
of bitter regrets, of affection suspended, not obliterated, by the distractions
of the scene around him! Amidst the natural and preternatural
horrors of his situation, he might be excused in delicacy from
carrying on a regular courtship. When ‘his father’s spirit was in
arms,’ it was not a time for the son to make love in. He could
neither marry Ophelia, nor wound her mind by explaining the cause
of his alienation, which he durst hardly trust himself to think of.
It would have taken him years to have come to a direct explanation
on the point. In the harassed state of his mind, he could not have
done much otherwise than he did. His conduct does not contradict
what he says when he sees her funeral,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nothing can be more affecting or beautiful than the Queen’s
apostrophe to Ophelia on throwing the flowers into the grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespear was thoroughly a master of the mixed motives of
human character, and he here shews us the Queen, who was so
criminal in some respects, not without sensibility and affection in
other relations of life.—Ophelia is a character almost too exquisitely
touching to be dwelt upon. Oh rose of May, oh flower too soon
faded! Her love, her madness, her death, are described with the
truest touches of tenderness and pathos. It is a character which
nobody but Shakespear could have drawn in the way that he has
done, and to the conception of which there is not even the smallest
approach, except in some of the old romantic ballads.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a> Her brother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Laertes, is a character we do not like so well: he is too hot and
choleric, and somewhat rhodomontade. Polonius is a perfect character
in its kind; nor is there any foundation for the objections which
have been made to the consistency of this part. It is said that he
acts very foolishly and talks very sensibly. There is no inconsistency
in that. Again, that he talks wisely at one time and foolishly at
another; that his advice to Laertes is very excellent, and his advice
to the King and Queen on the subject of Hamlet’s madness very
ridiculous. But he gives the one as a father, and is sincere in it;
he gives the other as a mere courtier, a busy-body, and is accordingly
officious, garrulous, and impertinent. In short, Shakespear has been
accused of inconsistency in this and other characters, only because
he has kept up the distinction which there is in nature, between the
understandings and the moral habits of men, between the absurdity of
their ideas and the absurdity of their motives. Polonius is not a fool,
but he makes himself so. His folly, whether in his actions or
speeches, comes under the head of impropriety of intention.</p>

<p class='c000'>We do not like to see our author’s plays acted, and least of all,
<span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>. There is no play that suffers so much in being transferred
to the stage. Hamlet himself seems hardly capable of being acted.
Mr. Kemble unavoidably fails in this character from a want of ease
and variety. The character of Hamlet is made up of undulating
lines; it has the yielding flexibility of ‘a wave o’ th’ sea.’ Mr.
Kemble plays it like a man in armour, with a determined inveteracy
of purpose, in one undeviating straight line, which is as remote from
the natural grace and refined susceptibility of the character, as the
sharp angles and abrupt starts which Mr. Kean introduces into the
part. Mr. Kean’s Hamlet is as much too splenetic and rash as
Mr. Kemble’s is too deliberate and formal. His manner is too strong
and pointed. He throws a severity, approaching to virulence, into
the common observations and answers. There is nothing of this in
Hamlet. He is, as it were, wrapped up in his reflections, and only
<em>thinks aloud</em>. There should therefore be no attempt to impress what
he says upon others by a studied exaggeration of emphasis or manner;
no <em>talking at</em> his hearers. There should be as much of the gentleman
and scholar as possible infused into the part, and as little of the actor.
A pensive air of sadness should sit reluctantly upon his brow, but no
appearance of fixed and sullen gloom. He is full of weakness and
melancholy, but there is no harshness in his nature. He is the most
amiable of misanthropes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>THE TEMPEST</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There can be little doubt that Shakespear was the most universal
genius that ever lived. ‘Either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral,
pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, scene individable or poem unlimited,
he is the only man. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light for him.’ He has not only the same absolute
command over our laughter and our tears, all the resources of passion,
of wit, of thought, of observation, but he has the most unbounded
range of fanciful invention, whether terrible or playful, the same
insight into the world of imagination that he has into the world of
reality; and over all there presides the same truth of character and
nature, and the same spirit of humanity. His ideal beings are as true
and natural as his real characters; that is, as consistent with themselves,
or if we suppose such beings to exist at all, they could not act,
speak, or feel otherwise than as he makes them. He has invented
for them a language, manners, and sentiments of their own, from the
tremendous imprecations of the Witches in <cite>Macbeth</cite>, when they do
‘a deed without a name,’ to the sylph-like expressions of Ariel, who
‘does his spiriting gently’; the mischievous tricks and gossipping of
Robin Goodfellow, or the uncouth gabbling and emphatic gesticulations
of Caliban in this play.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Tempest</span> is one of the most original and perfect of Shakespear’s
productions, and he has shewn in it all the variety of his powers. It
is full of grace and grandeur. The human and imaginary characters,
the dramatic and the grotesque, are blended together with the greatest
art, and without any appearance of it. Though he has here given
‘to airy nothing a local habitation and a name,’ yet that part which is
only the fantastic creation of his mind, has the same palpable texture,
and coheres ‘semblably’ with the rest. As the preternatural part
has the air of reality, and almost haunts the imagination with a sense
of truth, the real characters and events partake of the wildness of a
dream. The stately magician, Prospero, driven from his dukedom,
but around whom (so potent is his art) airy spirits throng numberless
to do his bidding; his daughter Miranda (‘worthy of that name’)
to whom all the power of his art points, and who seems the goddess
of the isle; the princely Ferdinand, cast by fate upon the haven of
his happiness in this idol of his love; the delicate Ariel; the savage
Caliban, half brute, half demon; the drunken ship’s crew—are all
connected parts of the story, and can hardly be spared from the place
they fill. Even the local scenery is of a piece and character with the
subject. Prospero’s enchanted island seems to have risen up out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the sea; the airy music, the tempest-tost vessel, the turbulent waves,
all have the effect of the landscape background of some fine picture.
Shakespear’s pencil is (to use an allusion of his own) ‘like the dyer’s
hand, subdued to what it works in.’ Every thing in him, though it
partakes of ‘the liberty of wit,’ is also subjected to ‘the law’ of the
understanding. For instance, even the drunken sailors, who are made
reeling-ripe, share, in the disorder of their minds and bodies, in the
tumult of the elements, and seem on shore to be as much at the mercy
of chance as they were before at the mercy of the winds and waves.
These fellows with their sea-wit are the least to our taste of any part
of the play: but they are as like drunken sailors as they can be, and
are an indirect foil to Caliban, whose figure acquires a classical dignity
in the comparison.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of Caliban is generally thought (and justly so) to be
one of the author’s master-pieces. It is not indeed pleasant to see
this character on the stage any more than it is to see the god Pan
personated there. But in itself it is one of the wildest and most
abstracted of all Shakespear’s characters, whose deformity whether of
body or mind is redeemed by the power and truth of the imagination
displayed in it. It is the essence of grossness, but there is not a
particle of vulgarity in it. Shakespear has described the brutal mind
of Caliban in contact with the pure and original forms of nature; the
character grows out of the soil where it is rooted, uncontrouled,
uncouth and wild, uncramped by any of the meannesses of custom.
It is ‘of the earth, earthy.’ It seems almost to have been dug out
of the ground, with a soul instinctively superadded to it answering to
its wants and origin. Vulgarity is not natural coarseness, but conventional
coarseness, learnt from others, contrary to, or without an
entire conformity of natural power and disposition; as fashion is the
common-place affectation of what is elegant and refined without any
feeling of the essence of it. Schlegel, the admirable German critic
on Shakespear, observes that Caliban is a poetical character, and
‘always speaks in blank verse.’ He first comes in thus:</p>

      <div class='line'>The rest o’ th’ island.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And again, he promises Trinculo his services thus, if he will free
him from his drudgery.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>‘I’ll shew thee the best springs; I’ll pluck thee berries,</div>

      <div class='line'>Young scamels from the rock.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In conducting Stephano and Trinculo to Prospero’s cell, Caliban
shews the superiority of natural capacity over greater knowledge and
greater folly; and in a former scene, when Ariel frightens them with
his music, Caliban to encourage them accounts for it in the eloquent
poetry of the senses.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—‘Be not afraid, the isle is full of noises,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments</div>
      <div class='line'>Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices,</div>
      <div class='line'>That if I then had waked after long sleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would make me sleep again; and then in dreaming,</div>
      <div class='line'>The clouds methought would open, and shew riches</div>
      <div class='line'>Ready to drop upon me; when I wak’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>I cried to dream again.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This is not more beautiful than it is true. The poet here shews
us the savage with the simplicity of a child, and makes the strange
monster amiable. Shakespear had to paint the human animal rude
and without choice in its pleasures, but not without the sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>pleasure or some germ of the affections. Master Barnardine in
<cite>Measure for Measure</cite>, the savage of civilized life, is an admirable
philosophical counterpart to Caliban.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespear has, as it were by design, drawn off from Caliban the
elements of whatever is ethereal and refined, to compound them in
the unearthly mould of Ariel. Nothing was ever more finely conceived
than this contrast between the material and the spiritual,
the gross and delicate. Ariel is imaginary power, the swiftness of
thought personified. When told to make good speed by Prospero,
he says, ‘I drink the air before me.’ This is something like Puck’s
boast on a similar occasion, ‘I’ll put a girdle round about the earth
in forty minutes.’ But Ariel differs from Puck in having a fellow
feeling in the interests of those he is employed about. How exquisite
is the following dialogue between him and Prospero!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Ariel.</em> Your charm so strongly works ‘em,</div>
      <div class='line'>That if you now beheld them, your affections</div>
      <div class='line'>Would become tender.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Prospero.</em> Dost thou think so, spirit?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Ariel.</em> Mine would, sir, were I human.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Prospero.</em> And mine shall.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling</div>
      <div class='line'>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</div>
      <div class='line'>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,</div>
      <div class='line'>Passion’d as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It has been observed that there is a peculiar charm in the songs
introduced in Shakespear, which, without conveying any distinct
images, seem to recall all the feelings connected with them, like
snatches of half-forgotten music heard indistinctly and at intervals.
There is this effect produced by Ariel’s songs, which (as we are
told) seem to sound in the air, and as if the person playing them
were invisible. We shall give one instance out of many of this
general power.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The courtship between Ferdinand and Miranda is one of the chief
beauties of this play. It is the very purity of love. The pretended
interference of Prospero with it heightens its interest, and is in
character with the magician, whose sense of preternatural power
makes him arbitrary, tetchy, and impatient of opposition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Tempest</span> is a finer play than the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>,
which has sometimes been compared with it; but it is not so fine a
poem. There are a greater number of beautiful passages in the latter.
Two of the most striking in the <span class='sc'>Tempest</span> are spoken by Prospero.
The one is that admirable one when the vision which he has conjured
up disappears, beginning ‘The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous

</div>

<p class='c000'>follows a sedentary trade, and he is accordingly represented as conceited,
serious, and fantastical. He is ready to undertake any thing
and every thing, as if it was as much a matter of course as the motion
of his loom and shuttle. He is for playing the tyrant, the lover, the
lady, the lion. ‘He will roar that it shall do any man’s heart good
to hear him’; and this being objected to as improper, he still has a
resource in his good opinion of himself, and ‘will roar you an ‘twere
any nightingale.’ Snug the Joiner is the moral man of the piece,
who proceeds by measurement and discretion in all things. You see
him with his rule and compasses in his hand. ‘Have you the lion’s
part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.’
‘You may do it extempore,’ says Quince, ‘for it is nothing but
roaring.’ Starveling the Tailor keeps the peace, and objects to the
lion and the drawn sword. ‘I believe we must leave the killing out
when all’s done.’ Starveling, however, does not start the objections
himself, but seconds them when made by others, as if he had not
spirit to express his fears without encouragement. It is too much
to suppose all this intentional: but it very luckily falls out so. Nature
includes all that is implied in the most subtle analytical distinctions;
and the same distinctions will be found in Shakespear. Bottom, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>is not only chief actor, but stage-manager for the occasion, has a
device to obviate the danger of frightening the ladies: ‘Write me a
prologue, and let the prologue seem to say, we will do no harm with
our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for better
assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom
the Weaver: this will put them out of fear.’ Bottom seems to have
understood the subject of dramatic illusion at least as well as any
modern essayist. If our holiday mechanic rules the roast among his
fellows, he is no less at home in his new character of an ass, ‘with
amiable cheeks, and fair large ears.’ He instinctively acquires a
most learned taste, and grows fastidious in the choice of dried peas
and bottled hay. He is quite familiar with his new attendants, and
assigns them their parts with all due gravity. ‘Monsieur Cobweb,
good Monsieur, get your weapon in your hand, and kill me a red-hipt
humble bee on the top of a thistle, and, good Monsieur, bring
me the honey-bag.’ What an exact knowledge is here shewn of
natural history!</p>

<p class='c000'>Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, is the leader of the fairy band. He
is the Ariel of the <span class='sc'>Midsummer Night’s Dream</span>; and yet as unlike as
can be to the Ariel in <cite>The Tempest</cite>. No other poet could have made
two such different characters out of the same fanciful materials and
situations. Ariel is a minister of retribution, who is touched with
the sense of pity at the woes he inflicts. Puck is a mad-cap sprite,
full of wantonness and mischief, who laughs at those whom he misleads—‘Lord,
what fools these mortals be!’ Ariel cleaves the air,
and executes his mission with the zeal of a winged messenger; Puck
is borne along on his fairy errand like the light and glittering gossamer
before the breeze. He is, indeed, a most Epicurean little gentleman,
dealing in quaint devices, and faring in dainty delights. Prospero
and his world of spirits are a set of moralists: but with Oberon and his
fairies we are launched at once into the empire of the butterflies.
How beautifully is this race of beings contrasted with the men and
women actors in the scene, by a single epithet which Titania gives to
the latter, ‘the human mortals!’ It is astonishing that Shakespear
should be considered, not only by foreigners, but by many of our
own critics, as a gloomy and heavy writer, who painted nothing but
‘gorgons and hydras, and chimeras dire.’ His subtlety exceeds that
of all other dramatic writers, insomuch that a celebrated person of
the present day said that he regarded him rather as a metaphysician
than a poet. His delicacy and sportive gaiety are infinite. In the
<span class='sc'>Midsummer Night’s Dream</span> alone, we should imagine, there is more
sweetness and beauty of description than in the whole range of French
poetry put together. What we mean is this, that we will produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>out of that single play ten passages, to which we do not think any
ten passages in the works of the French poets can be opposed, displaying
equal fancy and imagery. Shall we mention the remonstrance
of Helena to Hermia, or Titania’s description of her fairy train, or
her disputes with Oberon about the Indian boy, or Puck’s account of
himself and his employments, or the Fairy Queen’s exhortation to
the elves to pay due attendance upon her favourite, Bottom; or
Hippolita’s description of a chace, or Theseus’s answer? The two
last are as heroical and spirited as the others are full of luscious
tenderness. The reading of this play is like wandering in a grove by
moonlight: the descriptions breathe a sweetness like odours thrown
from beds of flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Titania’s exhortation to the fairies to wait upon Bottom, which is
remarkable for a certain cloying sweetness in the repetition of the
rhymes, is as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hop in his walks, and gambol in his eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,</div>
      <div class='line'>With purple grapes, green figs and mulberries;</div>
      <div class='line'>The honey-bags steal from the humble bees,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for night tapers crop their waxen thighs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And light them at the fiery glow-worm’s eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>To have my love to bed, and to arise:</div>
      <div class='line'>And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,</div>
      <div class='line'>To fan the moon-beams from his sleeping eyes;</div>

    </div>

<p class='c000'>Even Titian never made a hunting-piece of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i> so fresh and lusty,
and so near the first ages of the world as this.—</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been suggested to us, that the <span class='sc'>Midsummer Night’s Dream</span>
would do admirably to get up as a Christmas after-piece; and our
prompter proposed that Mr. Kean should play the part of Bottom, as
worthy of his great talents. He might, in the discharge of his duty,
offer to play the lady like any of our actresses that he pleased, the
lover or the tyrant like any of our actors that he pleased, and the lion
like ‘the most fearful wild-fowl living.’ The carpenter, the tailor,
and joiner, it was thought, would hit the galleries. The young
ladies in love would interest the side-boxes; and Robin Goodfellow
and his companions excite a lively fellow-feeling in the children from
school. There would be two courts, an empire within an empire, the
Athenian and the Fairy King and Queen, with their attendants, and
with all their finery. What an opportunity for processions, for the
sound of trumpets and glittering of spears! What a fluttering of
urchins’ painted wings; what a delightful profusion of gauze clouds
and airy spirits floating on them!</p>

<p class='c000'>Alas the experiment has been tried, and has failed; not through
the fault of Mr. Kean, who did not play the part of Bottom, nor of
Mr. Liston, who did, and who played it well, but from the nature of
things. The <span class='sc'>Midsummer Night’s Dream</span>, when acted, is converted
from a delightful fiction into a dull pantomime. All that is finest in
the play is lost in the representation. The spectacle was grand: but
the spirit was evaporated, the genius was fled.—Poetry and the stage
do not agree well together. The attempt to reconcile them in this
instance fails not only of effect, but of decorum. The <em>ideal</em> can have
no place upon the stage, which is a picture without perspective;
everything there is in the foreground. That which was merely an
airy shape, a dream, a passing thought, immediately becomes an unmanageable
reality. Where all is left to the imagination (as is the
case in reading) every circumstance, near or remote, has an equal
chance of being kept in mind, and tells according to the mixed
impression of all that has been suggested. But the imagination cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>sufficiently qualify the actual impressions of the senses. Any offence
given to the eye is not to be got rid of by explanation. Thus
Bottom’s head in the play is a fantastic illusion, produced by magic
spells: on the stage it is an ass’s head, and nothing more; certainly
a very strange costume for a gentleman to appear in. Fancy cannot
be embodied any more than a simile can be painted; and it is as idle
to attempt it as to personate <em>Wall</em> or <em>Moonshine</em>. Fairies are not
incredible, but fairies six feet high are so. Monsters are not shocking,
if they are seen at a proper distance. When ghosts appear at
mid-day, when apparitions stalk along Cheapside, then may the
<span class='sc'>Midsummer Night’s Dream</span> be represented without injury at Covent
Garden or at Drury Lane. The boards of a theatre and the regions
of fancy are not the same thing.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ROMEO AND JULIET</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Romeo and Juliet</span> is the only tragedy which Shakespear has written
entirely on a love-story. It is supposed to have been his first play, and
it deserves to stand in that proud rank. There is the buoyant spirit
of youth in every line, in the rapturous intoxication of hope, and in the
bitterness of despair. It has been said of <span class='sc'>Romeo and Juliet</span> by a great
critic, that ‘whatever is most intoxicating in the odour of a southern
spring, languishing in the song of the nightingale, or voluptuous in the
first opening of the rose, is to be found in this poem.’ The description
is true; and yet it does not answer to our idea of the play. For
if it has the sweetness of the rose, it has its freshness too; if it has
the languor of the nightingale’s song, it has also its giddy transport;
if it has the softness of a southern spring, it is as glowing and as
bright. There is nothing of a sickly and sentimental cast. Romeo
and Juliet are in love, but they are not love-sick. Every thing speaks
the very soul of pleasure, the high and healthy pulse of the passions:
the heart beats, the blood circulates and mantles throughout. Their
courtship is not an insipid interchange of sentiments lip-deep, learnt
at second-hand from poems and plays,—made up of beauties of the
most shadowy kind, of ‘fancies wan that hang the pensive head,’ of
evanescent smiles, and sighs that breathe not, of delicacy that shrinks
from the touch, and feebleness that scarce supports itself, an elaborate
vacuity of thought, and an artificial dearth of sense, spirit, truth, and
nature! It is the reverse of all this. It is Shakespear all over, and
Shakespear when he was young.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>We have heard it objected to <span class='sc'>Romeo and Juliet</span>, that it is founded
on an idle passion between a boy and a girl, who have scarcely seen
and can have but little sympathy or rational esteem for one another,
who have had no experience of the good or ills of life, and whose
raptures or despair must be therefore equally groundless and fantastical.
Whoever objects to the youth of the parties in this play as ‘too unripe
and crude’ to pluck the sweets of love, and wishes to see a first-love
carried on into a good old age, and the passions taken at the rebound,
when their force is spent, may find all this done in the <em>Stranger</em> and
in other German plays, where they do things by contraries, and transpose
nature to inspire sentiment and create philosophy. Shakespear
proceeded in a more strait-forward, and, we think, effectual way.
He did not endeavour to extract beauty from wrinkles, or the wild
throb of passion from the last expiring sigh of indifference. He did
not ‘gather grapes of thorns nor figs of thistles.’ It was not his way.
But he has given a picture of human life, such as it is in the order of
nature. He has founded the passion of the two lovers not on the
pleasures they had experienced, but on all the pleasures they had <em>not</em>
experienced. All that was to come of life was theirs. At that
untried source of promised happiness they slaked their thirst, and the
first eager draught made them drunk with love and joy. They were
in full possession of their senses and their affections. Their hopes
were of air, their desires of fire. Youth is the season of love, because
the heart is then first melted in tenderness from the touch of novelty,
and kindled to rapture, for it knows no end of its enjoyments or its
wishes. Desire has no limit but itself. Passion, the love and expectation
of pleasure, is infinite, extravagant, inexhaustible, till experience
comes to check and kill it. Juliet exclaims on her first interview
with Romeo—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘My bounty is as boundless as the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>My love as deep.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And why should it not? What was to hinder the thrilling tide of
pleasure, which had just gushed from her heart, from flowing on
without stint or measure, but experience which she was yet without?
What was to abate the transport of the first sweet sense of pleasure,
which her heart and her senses had just tasted, but indifference which
she was yet a stranger to? What was there to check the ardour of
hope, of faith, of constancy, just rising in her breast, but disappointment
which she had not yet felt! As are the desires and the hopes
of youthful passion, such is the keenness of its disappointments, and
their baleful effect. Such is the transition in this play from the
highest bliss to the lowest despair, from the nuptial couch to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>untimely grave. The only evil that even in apprehension befalls the
two lovers is the loss of the greatest possible felicity; yet this loss is
fatal to both, for they had rather part with life than bear the thought
of surviving all that had made life dear to them. In all this,
Shakespear has but followed nature, which existed in his time, as
well as now. The modern philosophy, which reduces the whole
theory of the mind to habitual impressions, and leaves the natural
impulses of passion and imagination out of the account, had not then
been discovered; or if it had, would have been little calculated for
the uses of poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the inadequacy of the same false system of philosophy to
account for the strength of our earliest attachments, which has led
Mr. Wordsworth to indulge in the mystical visions of Platonism in
his Ode on the Progress of Life. He has very admirably described
the vividness of our impressions in youth and childhood, and how
‘they fade by degrees into the light of common day,’ and he ascribes
the change to the supposition of a pre-existent state, as if our early
thoughts were nearer heaven, reflections of former trails of glory,
shadows of our past being. This is idle. It is not from the knowledge
of the past that the first impressions of things derive their gloss
and splendour, but from our ignorance of the future, which fills the
void to come with the warmth of our desires, with our gayest hopes,
and brightest fancies. It is the obscurity spread before it that colours
the prospect of life with hope, as it is the cloud which reflects the
rainbow. There is no occasion to resort to any mystical union and
transmission of feeling through different states of being to account for
the romantic enthusiasm of youth; nor to plant the root of hope in
the grave, nor to derive it from the skies. Its root is in the heart of
man: it lifts its head above the stars. Desire and imagination are
inmates of the human breast. The heaven ‘that lies about us in our
infancy’ is only a new world, of which we know nothing but what
we wish it to be, and believe all that we wish. In youth and boyhood,
the world we live in is the world of desire, and of fancy: it is
experience that brings us down to the world of reality. What is it
that in youth sheds a dewy light round the evening star? That
makes the daisy look so bright? That perfumes the hyacinth?
That embalms the first kiss of love? It is the delight of novelty,
and the seeing no end to the pleasure that we fondly believe is still in
store for us. The heart revels in the luxury of its own thoughts,
and is unable to sustain the weight of hope and love that presses upon
it.—The effects of the passion of love alone might have dissipated
Mr. Wordsworth’s theory, if he means any thing more by it than an
ingenious and poetical allegory. <em>That</em> at least is not a link in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>chain let down from other worlds; ‘the purple light of love’ is not
a dim reflection of the smiles of celestial bliss. It does not appear
till the middle of life, and then seems like ‘another morn risen on
mid-day.’ In this respect the soul comes into the world ‘in utter
nakedness.’ Love waits for the ripening of the youthful blood. The
sense of pleasure precedes the love of pleasure, but with the sense of
pleasure, as soon as it is felt, come thronging infinite desires and hopes
of pleasure, and love is mature as soon as born. It withers and it
dies almost as soon!</p>

<p class='c000'>This play presents a beautiful <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-d’œil</span></span></i> of the progress of human
life. In thought it occupies years, and embraces the circle of the
affections from childhood to old age. Juliet has become a great girl,
a young woman since we first remember her a little thing in the idle
prattle of the nurse. Lady Capulet was about her age when she
became a mother, and old Capulet somewhat impatiently tells his
younger visitors,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——‘I’ve seen the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I have worn a visor, and could tell</div>
      <div class='line'>A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as would please: ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus one period of life makes way for the following, and one
generation pushes another off the stage. One of the most striking
passages to show the intense feeling of youth in this play is Capulet’s
invitation to Paris to visit his entertainment.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘At my poor house, look to behold this night</div>
      <div class='line'>Earth-treading stars that make dark heav’n light;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such comfort as do lusty young men feel</div>
      <div class='line'>When well-apparel’d April on the heel</div>
      <div class='line'>Of limping winter treads, even such delight</div>
      <div class='line'>Among fresh female-buds shall you this night</div>
      <div class='line'>Inherit at my house.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The feelings of youth and of the spring are here blended together
like the breath of opening flowers. Images of vernal beauty appear to
have floated before the author’s mind, in writing this poem, in profusion.
Here is another of exquisite beauty, brought in more by
accident than by necessity. Montague declares of his son smit with a
hopeless passion, which he will not reveal—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘But he, his own affection’s counsellor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is to himself so secret and so close,</div>
      <div class='line'>So far from sounding and discovery,</div>
      <div class='line'>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>This casual description is as full of passionate beauty as when
Romeo dwells in frantic fondness on ‘the white wonder of his Juliet’s
hand.’ The reader may, if he pleases, contrast the exquisite pastoral
simplicity of the above lines with the gorgeous description of Juliet
when Romeo first sees her at her father’s house, surrounded by
company and artificial splendour.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What lady’s that which doth enrich the hand</div>
      <div class='line'>Of yonder knight?</div>
      <div class='line'>O she doth teach the torches to burn bright;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her beauty hangs upon the cheek of night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a rich jewel in an Æthiop’s ear.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It would be hard to say which of the two garden scenes is the
finest, that where he first converses with his love, or takes leave of
her the morning after their marriage. Both are like a heaven upon
earth; the blissful bowers of Paradise let down upon this lower world.
We will give only one passage of these well known scenes to shew
the perfect refinement and delicacy of Shakespear’s conception of the
female character. It is wonderful how Collins, who was a critic and
a poet of great sensibility, should have encouraged the common error
on this subject by saying—‘But stronger Shakespear felt for man
alone.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The passage we mean is Juliet’s apology for her maiden boldness.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face;</div>
      <div class='line'>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek</div>
      <div class='line'>For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny</div>
      <div class='line'>What I have spoke—but farewel compliment:</div>
      <div class='line'>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say, ay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I will take thee at thy word—Yet if thou swear’st,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou may’st prove false; at lovers’ perjuries</div>
      <div class='line'>They say Jove laughs. Oh gentle Romeo,</div>
      <div class='line'>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or if thou think I am too quickly won,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,</div>
      <div class='line'>So thou wilt woo: but else not for the world.</div>
      <div class='line'>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore thou may’st think my ‘haviour light;</div>
      <div class='line'>But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true</div>
      <div class='line'>Than those that have more cunning to be strange.</div>
      <div class='line'>I should have been more strange, I must confess</div>

      <div class='line'>And not impute this yielding to light love,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which the dark night hath so discovered.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>In this and all the rest, her heart, fluttering between pleasure, hope,
and fear, seems to have dictated to her tongue, and ‘calls true love
spoken simple modesty.’ Of the same sort, but bolder in virgin
innocence, is her soliloquy after her marriage with Romeo.</p>

      <div class='line'>Not yet enjoy’d: so tedious is this day,</div>
      <div class='line'>As is the night before some festival</div>

      <div class='line'>And may not wear them.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We the rather insert this passage here, inasmuch as we have no
doubt it has been expunged from the Family Shakespear. Such
critics do not perceive that the feelings of the heart sanctify, without
disguising, the impulses of nature. Without refinement themselves,
they confound modesty with hypocrisy. Not so the German critic,
Schlegel. Speaking of <span class='sc'>Romeo and Juliet</span>, he says, ‘It was reserved
for Shakespear to unite purity of heart and the glow of imagination,
sweetness and dignity of manners and passionate violence, in one ideal
picture.’ The character is indeed one of perfect truth and sweetness.
It has nothing forward, nothing coy, nothing affected or coquettish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>about it;—it is a pure effusion of nature. It is as frank as it is
modest, for it has no thought that it wishes to conceal. It reposes
in conscious innocence on the strength of its affections. Its delicacy
does not consist in coldness and reserve, but in combining warmth of
imagination and tenderness of heart with the most voluptuous sensibility.
Love is a gentle flame that rarifies and expands her whole
being. What an idea of trembling haste and airy grace, borne upon
the thoughts of love, does the Friar’s exclamation give of her, as she
approaches his cell to be married—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Here comes the lady. Oh, so light of foot</div>
      <div class='line'>Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint:</div>
      <div class='line'>A lover may bestride the gossamer,</div>
      <div class='line'>That idles in the wanton summer air,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet not fall, so light is vanity.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The tragic part of this character is of a piece with the rest. It is
the heroic founded on tenderness and delicacy. Of this kind are her
resolution to follow the Friar’s advice, and the conflict in her bosom
between apprehension and love when she comes to take the sleeping
poison. Shakespear is blamed for the mixture of low characters.
If this is a deformity, it is the source of a thousand beauties. One
instance is the contrast between the guileless simplicity of Juliet’s
attachment to her first love, and the convenient policy of the nurse in
advising her to marry Paris, which excites such indignation in her
mistress. ‘Ancient damnation! oh most wicked fiend,’ etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Romeo is Hamlet in love. There is the same rich exuberance of
passion and sentiment in the one, that there is of thought and sentiment
in the other. Both are absent and self-involved, both live out
of themselves in a world of imagination. Hamlet is abstracted from
every thing; Romeo is abstracted from every thing but his love, and
lost in it. His ‘frail thoughts dally with faint surmise,’ and are
fashioned out of the suggestions of hope, ‘the flatteries of sleep.’ He
is himself only in his Juliet; she is his only reality, his heart’s true
home and idol. The rest of the world is to him a passing dream.
How finely is this character pourtrayed where he recollects himself
on seeing Paris slain at the tomb of Juliet!—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What said my man, when my betossed soul</div>
      <div class='line'>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</div>
      <div class='line'>He told me Paris should have married Juliet.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And again, just before he hears the sudden tidings of her death—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘If I may trust the flattery of sleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>My bosom’s lord sits lightly on his throne,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit</div>
      <div class='line'>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.</div>
      <div class='line'>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>(Strange dream! that gives a dead man leave to think)</div>
      <div class='line'>And breath’d such life with kisses on my lips,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I reviv’d and was an emperour.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Romeo’s passion for Juliet is not a first love: it succeeds and
drives out his passion for another mistress, Rosaline, as the sun hides
the stars. This is perhaps an artifice (not absolutely necessary) to
give us a higher opinion of the lady, while the first absolute surrender
of her heart to him enhances the richness of the prize. The commencement,
progress, and ending of his second passion are however
complete in themselves, not injured if they are not bettered by the
first. The outline of the play is taken from an Italian novel; but
the dramatic arrangement of the different scenes between the lovers,
the more than dramatic interest in the progress of the story, the
developement of the characters with time and circumstances, just
according to the degree and kind of interest excited, are not inferior
to the expression of passion and nature. It has been ingeniously
remarked among other proofs of skill in the contrivance of the fable,
that the improbability of the main incident in the piece, the administering
of the sleeping-potion, is softened and obviated from the
beginning by the introduction of the Friar on his first appearance
culling simples and descanting on their virtues. Of the passionate
scenes in this tragedy, that between the Friar and Romeo when he
is told of his sentence of banishment, that between Juliet and the
Nurse when she hears of it, and of the death of her cousin Tybalt
(which bear no proportion in her mind, when passion after the first
shock of surprise throws its weight into the scale of her affections)
and the last scene at the tomb, are among the most natural and overpowering.
In all of these it is not merely the force of any one
passion that is given, but the slightest and most unlooked-for transitions
from one to another, the mingling currents of every different
feeling rising up and prevailing in turn, swayed by the master-mind
of the poet, as the waves undulate beneath the gliding storm. Thus
when Juliet has by her complaints encouraged the Nurse to say,
‘Shame come to Romeo,’ she instantly repels the wish, which she
had herself occasioned, by answering—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Blister’d be thy tongue</div>
      <div class='line'>For such a wish! He was not born to shame.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,</div>
      <div class='line'>For ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Sole monarch of the universal earth!</div>
      <div class='line'>O, what a beast was I to chide him so?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Nurse.</em> Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Juliet.</em> Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah my poor lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,</div>
      <div class='line'>When I, thy three-hours’ wife, have mangled it?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And then follows on the neck of her remorse and returning fondness,
that wish treading almost on the brink of impiety, but still held back
by the strength of her devotion to her lord, that ‘father, mother, nay,
or both were dead,’ rather than Romeo banished. If she requires
any other excuse, it is in the manner in which Romeo echoes her
frantic grief and disappointment in the next scene at being banished
from her.—Perhaps one of the finest pieces of acting that ever was
witnessed on the stage, is Mr. Kean’s manner of doing this scene
and his repetition of the word, <em>Banished</em>. He treads close indeed
upon the genius of his author.</p>

<p class='c000'>A passage which this celebrated actor and able commentator on
Shakespear (actors are the best commentators on the poets) did not
give with equal truth or force of feeling was the one which Romeo
makes at the tomb of Juliet, before he drinks the poison.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lines in this speech, describing the loveliness of Juliet, who is
supposed to be dead, have been compared to those in which it is
said of Cleopatra after her death, that she looked ‘as she would take
another Antony in her strong toil of grace’; and a question has been
started which is the finest, that we do not pretend to decide. We
can more easily decide between Shakespear and any other author,
than between him and himself.—Shall we quote any more passages to
shew his genius or the beauty of <span class='sc'>Romeo and Juliet</span>? At that rate, we
might quote the whole. The late Mr. Sheridan, on being shewn a
volume of the Beauties of Shakespear, very properly asked—‘But
where are the other eleven?’ The character of Mercutio in this
play is one of the most mercurial and spirited of the productions of
Shakespear’s comic muse.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>LEAR</h3>

<p class='c011'>We wish that we could pass this play over, and say nothing about
it. All that we can say must fall far short of the subject; or even
of what we ourselves conceive of it. To attempt to give a description
of the play itself or of its effect upon the mind, is mere impertinence;
yet we must say something.—It is then the best of all
Shakespear’s plays, for it is the one in which he was the most in
earnest. He was here fairly caught in the web of his own imagination.
The passion which he has taken as his subject is that which
strikes its root deepest into the human heart; of which the bond is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>the hardest to be unloosed; and the cancelling and tearing to pieces
of which gives the greatest revulsion to the frame. This depth of
nature, this force of passion, this tug and war of the elements of our
being, this firm faith in filial piety, and the giddy anarchy and whirling
tumult of the thoughts at finding this prop failing it, the contrast
between the fixed, immoveable basis of natural affection, and the rapid,
irregular starts of imagination, suddenly wrenched from all its
accustomed holds and resting-places in the soul, this is what Shakespear
has given, and what nobody else but he could give. So we
believe.—The mind of Lear, staggering between the weight of
attachment and the hurried movements of passion, is like a tall ship
driven about by the winds, buffetted by the furious waves, but that
still rides above the storm, having its anchor fixed in the bottom of
the sea; or it is like the sharp rock circled by the eddying whirlpool
that foams and beats against it, or like the solid promontory pushed
from its basis by the force of an earthquake.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of Lear itself is very finely conceived for the purpose.
It is the only ground on which such a story could be built with
the greatest truth and effect. It is his rash haste, his violent impetuosity,
his blindness to every thing but the dictates of his passions or
affections, that produces all his misfortunes, that aggravates his
impatience of them, that enforces our pity for him. The part which
Cordelia bears in the scene is extremely beautiful: the story is almost
told in the first words she utters. We see at once the precipice on
which the poor old king stands from his own extravagant and credulous
importunity, the indiscreet simplicity of her love (which, to be
sure, has a little of her father’s obstinacy in it) and the hollowness of
her sisters’ pretensions. Almost the first burst of that noble tide of
passion, which runs through the play, is in the remonstrance of Kent
to his royal master on the injustice of his sentence against his youngest
daughter—‘Be Kent unmannerly, when Lear is mad!’ This manly
plainness, which draws down on him the displeasure of the unadvised
king, is worthy of the fidelity with which he adheres to his fallen
fortunes. The true character of the two eldest daughters, Regan
and Gonerill (they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like
to repeat their names) breaks out in their answer to Cordelia who
desires them to treat their father well—‘Prescribe not us our duties’—their
hatred of advice being in proportion to their determination to
do wrong, and to their hypocritical pretensions to do right. Their
deliberate hypocrisy adds the last finishing to the odiousness of their
characters. It is the absence of this detestable quality that is the
only relief in the character of Edmund the Bastard, and that at
times reconciles us to him. We are not tempted to exaggerate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>guilt of his conduct, when he himself gives it up as a bad business,
and writes himself down ‘plain villain.’ Nothing more can be said
about it. His religious honesty in this respect is admirable. One
speech of his is worth a million. His father, Gloster, whom he has
just deluded with a forged story of his brother Edgar’s designs against
his life, accounts for his unnatural behaviour and the strange depravity
of the times from the late eclipses in the sun and moon. Edmund,
who is in the secret, says when he is gone—‘This is the excellent
foppery of the world, that when we are sick in fortune (often the surfeits
of our own behaviour) we make guilty of our disasters the sun,
the moon, and stars: as if we were villains on necessity; fools by
heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treacherous by spherical
predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience
of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine
thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay his
goatish disposition on the charge of a star! My father compounded
with my mother under the Dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under
Ursa Major: so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous. Tut!
I should have been what I am, had the maidenliness star in the firmament
twinkled on my bastardising.’—The whole character, its careless,
light-hearted villainy, contrasted with the sullen, rancorous
malignity of Regan and Gonerill, its connection with the conduct of
the under-plot, in which Gloster’s persecution of one of his sons and
the ingratitude of another, form a counterpart to the mistakes and
misfortunes of Lear,—his double amour with the two sisters, and the
share which he has in bringing about the fatal catastrophe, are all
managed with an uncommon degree of skill and power.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been said, and we think justly, that the third act of <cite>Othello</cite>
and the three first acts of <span class='sc'>Lear</span>, are Shakespear’s great master-pieces
in the logic of passion: that they contain the highest examples not
only of the force of individual passion, but of its dramatic vicissitudes
and striking effects arising from the different circumstances and
characters of the persons speaking. We see the ebb and flow of the
feeling, its pauses and feverish starts, its impatience of opposition, its
accumulating force when it has time to recollect itself, the manner in
which it avails itself of every passing word or gesture, its haste to
repel insinuation, the alternate contraction and dilatation of the soul,
and all ‘the dazzling fence of controversy’ in this mortal combat with
poisoned weapons, aimed at the heart, where each wound is fatal.
We have seen in <cite>Othello</cite>, how the unsuspecting frankness and impetuous
passions of the Moor are played upon and exasperated by the artful
dexterity of Iago. In the present play, that which aggravates the
sense of sympathy in the reader, and of uncontroulable anguish in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>swoln heart of Lear, is the petrifying indifference, the cold, calculating,
obdurate selfishness of his daughters. His keen passions seem
whetted on their stony hearts. The contrast would be too painful,
the shock too great, but for the intervention of the Fool, whose well-timed
levity comes in to break the continuity of feeling when it can
no longer be borne, and to bring into play again the fibres of the heart
just as they are growing rigid from overstrained excitement. The
imagination is glad to take refuge in the half-comic, half-serious comments
of the Fool, just as the mind under the extreme anguish of a
surgical operation vents itself in sallies of wit. The character was
also a grotesque ornament of the barbarous times, in which alone the
tragic ground-work of the story could be laid. In another point of
view it is indispensable, inasmuch as while it is a diversion to the too
great intensity of our disgust, it carries the pathos to the highest
pitch of which it is capable, by shewing the pitiable weakness of the
old king’s conduct and its irretrievable consequences in the most
familiar point of view. Lear may well ‘beat at the gate which let
his folly in,’ after, as the Fool says, ‘he has made his daughters his
mothers.’ The character is dropped in the third act to make room
for the entrance of Edgar as Mad Tom, which well accords with the
increasing bustle and wildness of the incidents; and nothing can be
more complete than the distinction between Lear’s real and Edgar’s
assumed madness, while the resemblance in the cause of their distresses,
from the severing of the nearest ties of natural affection, keeps
up a unity of interest. Shakespear’s mastery over his subject, if it
was not art, was owing to a knowledge of the connecting links of the
passions, and their effect upon the mind, still more wonderful than
any systematic adherence to rules, and that anticipated and outdid
all the efforts of the most refined art, not inspired and rendered
instinctive by genius.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most perfect displays of dramatic power is the first
interview between Lear and his daughter, after the designed affronts
upon him, which till one of his knights reminds him of them, his
sanguine temperament had led him to overlook. He returns with his
train from hunting, and his usual impatience breaks out in his first
words, ‘Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go, get it ready.’ He
then encounters the faithful Kent in disguise, and retains him in his
service; and the first trial of his honest duty is to trip up the heels of
the officious Steward who makes so prominent and despicable a figure
through the piece. On the entrance of Gonerill the following dialogue
takes place:—</p>

<p class='c000'>This is certainly fine: no wonder that Lear says after it, ‘O let
me not be mad, not mad, sweet heavens,’ feeling its effects by anticipation;
but fine as is this burst of rage and indignation at the first
blow aimed at his hopes and expectations, it is nothing near so fine
as what follows from his double disappointment, and his lingering
efforts to see which of them he shall lean upon for support and find
comfort in, when both his daughters turn against his age and weakness.
It is with some difficulty that Lear gets to speak with his
daughter Regan, and her husband, at Gloster’s castle. In concert
with Gonerill they have left their own home on purpose to avoid
him. His apprehensions are first alarmed by this circumstance, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>when Gloster, whose guests they are, urges the fiery temper of the
Duke of Cornwall as an excuse for not importuning him a second
time, Lear breaks out—</p>

      <div class='line'>I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall, and his wife.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Afterwards, feeling perhaps not well himself, he is inclined to
admit their excuse from illness, but then recollecting that they have
set his messenger (Kent) in the stocks, all his suspicions are roused
again, and he insists on seeing them.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there is any thing in any author like this yearning of the heart,
these throes of tenderness, this profound expression of all that can
be thought and felt in the most heart-rending situations, we are glad
of it; but it is in some author that we have not read.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scene in the storm, where he is exposed to all the fury of
the elements, though grand and terrible, is not so fine, but the moralising
scenes with Mad Tom, Kent, and Gloster, are upon a par with
the former. His exclamation in the supposed trial-scene of his
daughters, ‘See the little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart,
see they bark at me,’ his issuing his orders, ‘Let them anatomize
Regan, see what breeds about her heart,’ and his reflection
when he sees the misery of Edgar, ‘Nothing but his unkind daughters
could have brought him to this,’ are in a style of pathos, where the
extremest resources of the imagination are called in to lay open the
deepest movements of the heart, which was peculiar to Shakespear.
In the same style and spirit is his interrupting the Fool who asks
‘whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman,’ by answering
‘A king, a king.—</p>

<p class='c000'>The indirect part that Gloster takes in these scenes where his
generosity leads him to relieve Lear and resent the cruelty of his
daughters, at the very time that he is himself instigated to seek the
life of his son, and suffering under the sting of his supposed ingratitude,
is a striking accompaniment to the situation of Lear. Indeed,
the manner in which the threads of the story are woven together
is almost as wonderful in the way of art as the carrying on the tide
of passion, still varying and unimpaired, is on the score of nature.
Among the remarkable instances of this kind are Edgar’s meeting
with his old blind father; the deception he practises upon him when
he pretends to lead him to the top of Dover-cliff—‘Come on, sir,
here’s the place,’ to prevent his ending his life and miseries together;
his encounter with the perfidious Steward whom he kills, and his
finding the letter from Gonerill to his brother upon him which leads
to the final catastrophe, and brings the wheel of Justice ‘full circle
home’ to the guilty parties. The bustle and rapid succession of
events in the last scenes is surprising. But the meeting between Lear
and Cordelia is by far the most affecting part of them. It has all
the wildness of poetry, and all the heart-felt truth of nature. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>previous account of her reception of the news of his unkind treatment,
her involuntary reproaches to her sisters, ‘Shame, ladies,
shame,’ Lear’s backwardness to see his daughter, the picture of the
desolate state to which he is reduced, ‘Alack, ’tis he; why he was
met even now, as mad as the vex’d sea, singing aloud,’ only prepare
the way for and heighten our expectation of what follows, and
assuredly this expectation is not disappointed when through the
tender care of Cordelia he revives and recollects her.</p>

      <div class='line'>Methinks, I shou’d know you, and know this man;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The concluding events are sad, painfully sad; but their pathos is
extreme. The oppression of the feelings is relieved by the very
interest we take in the misfortunes of others, and by the reflections
to which they give birth. Cordelia is hanged in prison by the orders
of the bastard Edmund, which are known too late to be countermanded,
and Lear dies broken-hearted, lamenting over her.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He dies, and indeed we feel the truth of what Kent says on the
occasion—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him,</div>
      <div class='line'>That would upon the rack of this rough world</div>
      <div class='line'>Stretch him out longer.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Yet a happy ending has been contrived for this play, which is
approved of by Dr. Johnson and condemned by Schlegel. A better
authority than either, on any subject in which poetry and feeling are
concerned, has given it in favour of Shakespear, in some remarks on
the acting of Lear, with which we shall conclude this account:</p>

<p class='c016'>‘The <span class='sc'>Lear</span> of Shakespear cannot be acted. The contemptible machinery
with which they mimic the storm which he goes out in, is not more
inadequate to represent the horrors of the real elements than any actor can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>be to represent Lear. The greatness of Lear is not in corporal dimension,
but in intellectual; the explosions of his passions are terrible as a volcano:
they are storms turning up and disclosing to the bottom that rich sea, his
mind, with all its vast riches. It is his mind which is laid bare. This
case of flesh and blood seems too insignificant to be thought on; even as
he himself neglects it. On the stage we see nothing but corporal infirmities
and weakness, the impotence of rage—while we read it, we see not Lear,
but we are Lear;—we are in his mind; we are sustained by a grandeur,
which baffles the malice of daughters and storms; in the aberrations of
his reason, we discover a mighty irregular power of reasoning, immethodised
from the ordinary purposes of life, but exerting its powers, as the wind
blows where it listeth, at will on the corruptions and abuses of mankind.
What have looks or tones to do with that sublime identification of his age
with that of <em>the heavens themselves</em>, when in his reproaches to them for
conniving at the injustice of his children, he reminds them that “they
themselves are old!” What gesture shall we appropriate to this? What
has the voice or the eye to do with such things? But the play is beyond
all art, as the tamperings with it shew: it is too hard and stony: it must
have love-scenes, and a happy ending. It is not enough that Cordelia
is a daughter, she must shine as a lover too. Tate has put his hook in the
nostrils of this Leviathan, for Garrick and his followers, the shew-men of
the scene, to draw it about more easily. A happy ending!—as if the
living martyrdom that Lear had gone through,—the flaying of his feelings
alive, did not make a fair dismissal from the stage of life the only decorous
thing for him. If he is to live and be happy after, if he could sustain this
world’s burden after, why all this pudder and preparation—why torment
us with all this unnecessary sympathy? As if the childish pleasure of
getting his gilt robes and sceptre again could tempt him to act over again
his misused station,—as if at his years and with his experience, any thing
was left but to die.’<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Four things have struck us in reading <span class='sc'>Lear</span>:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. That poetry is an interesting study, for this reason, that it
relates to whatever is most interesting in human life. Whoever
therefore has a contempt for poetry, has a contempt for himself and
humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. That the language of poetry is superior to the language of
painting; because the strongest of our recollections relate to feelings,
not to faces.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. That the greatest strength of genius is shewn in describing the
strongest passions: for the power of the imagination, in works of
invention, must be in proportion to the force of the natural impressions,
which are the subject of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. That the circumstance which balances the pleasure against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>pain in tragedy is, that in proportion to the greatness of the evil, is
our sense and desire of the opposite good excited; and that our
sympathy with actual suffering is lost in the strong impulse given to
our natural affections, and carried away with the swelling tide of
passion, that gushes from and relieves the heart.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>RICHARD II.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Richard II.</span> is a play little known compared with <cite>Richard III.</cite>
which last is a play that every unfledged candidate for theatrical fame
chuses to strut and fret his hour upon the stage in; yet we confess
that we prefer the nature and feeling of the one to the noise and
bustle of the other; at least, as we are so often forced to see it acted.
In <span class='sc'>Richard II.</span> the weakness of the king leaves us leisure to take a
greater interest in the misfortunes of the man. After the first act,
in which the arbitrariness of his behaviour only proves his want of
resolution, we see him staggering under the unlooked-for blows of
fortune, bewailing his loss of kingly power, not preventing it, sinking
under the aspiring genius of Bolingbroke, his authority trampled on,
his hopes failing him, and his pride crushed and broken down under
insults and injuries, which his own misconduct had provoked, but
which he has not courage or manliness to resent. The change of
tone and behaviour in the two competitors for the throne according
to their change of fortune, from the capricious sentence of banishment
passed by Richard upon Bolingbroke, the suppliant offers and modest
pretensions of the latter on his return to the high and haughty tone
with which he accepts Richard’s resignation of the crown after the
loss of all his power, the use which he makes of the deposed king
to grace his triumphal progress through the streets of London, and
the final intimation of his wish for his death, which immediately finds
a servile executioner, is marked throughout with complete effect and
without the slightest appearance of effort. The steps by which
Bolingbroke mounts the throne are those by which Richard sinks
into the grave. We feel neither respect nor love for the deposed
monarch; for he is as wanting in energy as in principle: but we pity
him, for he pities himself. His heart is by no means hardened
against himself, but bleeds afresh at every new stroke of mischance,
and his sensibility, absorbed in his own person, and unused to misfortune,
is not only tenderly alive to its own sufferings, but without
the fortitude to bear them. He is, however, human in his distresses;
for to feel pain, and sorrow, weakness, disappointment, remorse and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>anguish, is the lot of humanity, and we sympathize with him accordingly.
The sufferings of the man make us forget that he ever was
a king.</p>

<p class='c000'>The right assumed by sovereign power to trifle at its will with the
happiness of others as a matter of course, or to remit its exercise as
a matter of favour, is strikingly shewn in the sentence of banishment
so unjustly pronounced on Bolingbroke and Mowbray, and in what
Bolingbroke says when four years of his banishment are taken off,
with as little reason.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘How long a time lies in one little word!</div>
      <div class='line'>Four lagging winters and four wanton springs</div>
      <div class='line'>End in a word: such is the breath of kings.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A more affecting image of the loneliness of a state of exile can
hardly be given than by what Bolingbroke afterwards observes of his
having ‘sighed his English breath in foreign clouds’; or than that
conveyed in Mowbray’s complaint at being banished for life.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The language I have learned these forty years,</div>
      <div class='line'>My native English, now I must forego;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now my tongue’s use is to me no more</div>
      <div class='line'>Than an unstringed viol or a harp,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or like a cunning instrument cas’d up,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or being open, put into his hands</div>
      <div class='line'>That knows no touch to tune the harmony.</div>
      <div class='line'>I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Too far in years to be a pupil now.’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How very beautiful is all this, and at the same time how very
<em>English</em> too!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Richard II.</span> may be considered as the first of that series of English
historical plays, in which ‘is hung armour of the invincible knights
of old,’ in which their hearts seem to strike against their coats
of mail, where their blood tingles for the fight, and words are but
the harbingers of blows. Of this state of accomplished barbarism
the appeal of Bolingbroke and Mowbray is an admirable specimen.
Another of these ‘keen encounters of their wits,’ which serve to
whet the talkers’ swords, is where Aumerle answers in the presence
of Bolingbroke to the charge which Bagot brings against him of being
an accessory in Gloster’s death.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The truth is, that there is neither truth nor honour in all these
noble persons: they answer words with words, as they do blows
with blows, in mere self defence: nor have they any principle
whatever but that of courage in maintaining any wrong they dare
commit, or any falsehood which they find it useful to assert. How
different were these noble knights and ‘barons bold’ from their more
refined descendants in the present day, who, instead of deciding
questions of right by brute force, refer everything to convenience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>fashion, and good breeding! In point of any abstract love of truth
or justice, they are just the same now that they were then.</p>

<p class='c000'>The characters of old John of Gaunt and of his brother York,
uncles to the King, the one stern and foreboding, the other honest,
good-natured, doing all for the best, and therefore doing nothing,
are well kept up. The speech of the former, in praise of England,
is one of the most eloquent that ever was penned. We should
perhaps hardly be disposed to feed the pampered egotism of our
countrymen by quoting this description, were it not that the conclusion
of it (which looks prophetic) may qualify any improper
degree of exultation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The character of Bolingbroke, afterwards Henry <span class='fss'>IV.</span> is drawn
with a masterly hand:—patient for occasion, and then steadily availing
himself of it, seeing his advantage afar off, but only seizing on it
when he has it within his reach, humble, crafty, bold, and aspiring,
encroaching by regular but slow degrees, building power on opinion,
and cementing opinion by power. His disposition is first unfolded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>by Richard himself, who however is too self-willed and secure to
make a proper use of his knowledge.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,</div>
      <div class='line'>Observed his courtship of the common people:</div>
      <div class='line'>How he did seem to dive into their hearts,</div>
      <div class='line'>With humble and familiar courtesy,</div>
      <div class='line'>What reverence he did throw away on slaves;</div>
      <div class='line'>Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles,</div>
      <div class='line'>And patient under-bearing of his fortune,</div>
      <div class='line'>As ‘twere to banish their affections with him.</div>
      <div class='line'>Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;</div>
      <div class='line'>A brace of draymen bid God speed him well,</div>
      <div class='line'>And had the tribute of his supple knee,</div>
      <div class='line'>With thanks my countrymen, my loving friends;</div>
      <div class='line'>As were our England in reversion his,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he our subjects’ next degree in hope.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Afterwards, he gives his own character to Percy, in these words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I thank thee, gentle Percy, and be sure</div>
      <div class='line'>I count myself in nothing else so happy,</div>
      <div class='line'>As in a soul rememb’ring my good friends;</div>
      <div class='line'>And as my fortune ripens with thy love,</div>
      <div class='line'>It shall be still thy true love’s recompense.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We know how he afterwards kept his promise. His bold assertion
of his own rights, his pretended submission to the king, and the
ascendancy which he tacitly assumes over him without openly claiming
it, as soon as he has him in his power, are characteristic traits
of this ambitious and politic usurper. But the part of Richard
himself gives the chief interest to the play. His folly, his vices, his
misfortunes, his reluctance to part with the crown, his fear to keep
it, his weak and womanish regrets, his starting tears, his fits of hectic
passion, his smothered majesty, pass in succession before us, and make
a picture as natural as it is affecting. Among the most striking
touches of pathos are his wish ‘O that I were a mockery king of
snow to melt away before the sun of Bolingbroke,’ and the incident
of the poor groom who comes to visit him in prison, and tells him
how ‘it yearned his heart that Bolingbroke upon his coronation-day
rode on Roan Barbary.’ We shall have occasion to return hereafter
to the character of Richard <span class='fss'>II.</span> in speaking of Henry <span class='fss'>VI.</span> There is
only one passage more, the description of his entrance into London
with Bolingbroke, which we should like to quote here, if it had not
been so used and worn out, so thumbed and got by rote, so praised
and painted; but its beauty surmounts all these considerations.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>HENRY IV<br /> <span class='c020'>IN TWO PARTS</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>If Shakespear’s fondness for the ludicrous sometimes led to faults in
his tragedies (which was not often the case) he has made us amends
by the character of Falstaff. This is perhaps the most substantial
comic character that ever was invented. Sir John carries a most
portly presence in the mind’s eye; and in him, not to speak it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>profanely, ‘we behold the fulness of the spirit of wit and humour
bodily.’ We are as well acquainted with his person as his mind,
and his jokes come upon us with double force and relish from the
quantity of flesh through which they make their way, as he shakes
his fat sides with laughter, or ‘lards the lean earth as he walks along.’
Other comic characters seem, if we approach and handle them, to
resolve themselves into air, ‘into thin air’; but this is embodied and
palpable to the grossest apprehension: it lies ‘three fingers deep upon
the ribs,’ it plays about the lungs and the diaphragm with all the force
of animal enjoyment. His body is like a good estate to his mind,
from which he receives rents and revenues of profit and pleasure in
kind, according to its extent, and the richness of the soil. Wit is
often a meagre substitute for pleasurable sensation; an effusion of
spleen and petty spite at the comforts of others, from feeling none in
itself. Falstaff’s wit is an emanation of a fine constitution; an
exuberance of good-humour and good-nature; an overflowing of his
love of laughter and good-fellowship; a giving vent to his heart’s
ease, and over-contentment with himself and others. He would not
be in character, if he were not so fat as he is; for there is the
greatest keeping in the boundless luxury of his imagination and the
pampered self-indulgence of his physical appetites. He manures and
nourishes his mind with jests, as he does his body with sack and
sugar. He carves out his jokes, as he would a capon or a haunch
of venison, where there is <em>cut and come again</em>; and pours out upon
them the oil of gladness. His tongue drops fatness, and in the
chambers of his brain ‘it snows of meat and drink.’ He keeps
up perpetual holiday and open house, and we live with him in a
round of invitations to a rump and dozen.—Yet we are not to suppose
that he was a mere sensualist. All this is as much in imagination
as in reality. His sensuality does not engross and stupify his other
faculties, but ‘ascends me into the brain, clears away all the dull,
crude vapours that environ it, and makes it full of nimble, fiery, and
delectable shapes.’ His imagination keeps up the ball after his senses
have done with it. He seems to have even a greater enjoyment of
the freedom from restraint, of good cheer, of his ease, of his vanity,
in the ideal exaggerated description which he gives of them, than
in fact. He never fails to enrich his discourse with allusions to
eating and drinking, but we never see him at table. He carries his
own larder about with him, and he is himself ‘a tun of man.’ His
pulling out the bottle in the field of battle is a joke to shew his
contempt for glory accompanied with danger, his systematic adherence
to his Epicurean philosophy in the most trying circumstances.
Again, such is his deliberate exaggeration of his own vices, that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>does not seem quite certain whether the account of his hostess’s bill,
found in his pocket, with such an out-of-the-way charge for capons
and sack with only one halfpenny-worth of bread, was not put there
by himself as a trick to humour the jest upon his favourite propensities,
and as a conscious caricature of himself. He is represented
as a liar, a braggart, a coward, a glutton, etc. and yet we are not
offended but delighted with him; for he is all these as much to
amuse others as to gratify himself. He openly assumes all these
characters to shew the humourous part of them. The unrestrained
indulgence of his own ease, appetites, and convenience, has neither
malice nor hypocrisy in it. In a word, he is an actor in himself
almost as much as upon the stage, and we no more object to the
character of Falstaff in a moral point of view than we should think
of bringing an excellent comedian, who should represent him to the
life, before one of the police offices. We only consider the number
of pleasant lights in which he puts certain foibles (the more pleasant
as they are opposed to the received rules and necessary restraints of
society) and do not trouble ourselves about the consequences resulting
from them, for no mischievous consequences do result. Sir John is
old as well as fat, which gives a melancholy retrospective tinge to
the character; and by the disparity between his inclinations and his
capacity for enjoyment, makes it still more ludicrous and fantastical.</p>

<p class='c000'>The secret of Falstaff’s wit is for the most part a masterly presence
of mind, an absolute self-possession, which nothing can disturb. His
repartees are involuntary suggestions of his self-love; instinctive
evasions of every thing that threatens to interrupt the career of his
triumphant jollity and self-complacency. His very size floats him
out of all his difficulties in a sea of rich conceits; and he turns round
on the pivot of his convenience, with every occasion and at a moment’s
warning. His natural repugnance to every unpleasant thought or
circumstance, of itself makes light of objections, and provokes the
most extravagant and licentious answers in his own justification.
His indifference to truth puts no check upon his invention, and the
more improbable and unexpected his contrivances are, the more
happily does he seem to be delivered of them, the anticipation of
their effect acting as a stimulus to the gaiety of his fancy. The
success of one adventurous sally gives him spirits to undertake another:
he deals always in round numbers, and his exaggerations and excuses
are ‘open, palpable, monstrous as the father that begets them.’ His
dissolute carelessness of what he says discovers itself in the first
dialogue with the Prince.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘<em>Falstaff.</em> By the lord, thou say’st true, lad; and is not mine hostess
of the tavern a most sweet wench?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span><em>P. Henry.</em> As the honey of Hibla, my old lad of the castle; and is not
a buff-jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> How now, how now, mad wag, what in thy quips and thy
quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a buff-jerkin?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> Why, what a pox have I to do with mine hostess of the
tavern?’</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same scene he afterwards affects melancholy, from pure
satisfaction of heart, and professes reform, because it is the farthest
thing in the world from his thoughts. He has no qualms of conscience,
and therefore would as soon talk of them as of anything else when the
humour takes him.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘<em>Falstaff.</em> But Hal, I pr’ythee trouble me no more with vanity. I would
to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be
bought: an old lord of council rated me the other day in the street about
you, sir; but I mark’d him not, and yet he talked very wisely, and in the
street too.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the street, and no
man regards it.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt
a saint. Thou hast done much harm unto me, Hal; God forgive thee for
it. Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now I am, if a man
should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over
this life, and I will give it over, by the lord; an I do not, I am a villain.
I’ll be damn’d for never a king’s son in Christendom.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> Where shall we take a purse to-morrow, Jack?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> Where thou wilt, lad, I’ll make one; an I do not, call me
villain, and baffle me.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> I see good amendment of life in thee, from praying to purse-taking.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal. ’Tis no sin for a man to
labour in his vocation.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the other prominent passages, his account of his pretended
resistance to the robbers, ‘who grew from four men in buckram into
eleven’ as the imagination of his own valour increased with his relating
it, his getting off when the truth is discovered by pretending he knew
the Prince, the scene in which in the person of the old king he
lectures the prince and gives himself a good character, the soliloquy
on honour, and description of his new-raised recruits, his meeting with
the chief justice, his abuse of the Prince and Poins, who overhear him,
to Doll Tearsheet, his reconciliation with Mrs. Quickly who has
arrested him for an old debt, and whom he persuades to pawn her
plate to lend him ten pounds more, and the scenes with Shallow and
Silence, are all inimitable. Of all of them, the scene in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Falstaff plays the part, first, of the King, and then of Prince Henry,
is the one that has been the most often quoted. We must quote it
once more in illustration of our remarks.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘<em>Falstaff.</em> Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also
how thou art accompanied: for though the camomile, the more it is trodden
on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears.
That thou art my son, I have partly thy mother’s word, partly my own
opinion; but chiefly, a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging
of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here
lies the point;——Why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher, and eat blackberries? A question
not to be ask’d. Shall the son of England prove a thief, and take purses?
a question not to be ask’d. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often
heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch: this
pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou
keepest: for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not
in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also:—and yet
there is a virtuous man, whom I have often noted in thy company, but I
know not his name.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> What manner of man, an it like your majesty?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> A goodly portly man, i’faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful
look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think, his age
some fifty, or, by’r-lady, inclining to threescore; and now I do remember
me, his name is Falstaff: if that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth
me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the fruit may be known
by the tree, as the tree by the fruit, then peremptorily I speak it, there is
virtue in that Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now,
thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast thou been this month?</p>

in word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker, or a

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> Well, here I am set.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> And here I stand:—judge, my masters.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> Now, Harry, whence come you?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> My noble lord, from Eastcheap.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> S’blood, my lord, they are false:—nay, I ‘ll tickle ye for a young
prince, i’faith.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne’er look on me.
Thou art violently carried away from grace: there is a devil haunts thee,
in the likeness of a fat old man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of beastliness,
that swoln parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuft
cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manning-tree ox with the pudding in his
belly, that reverend vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity
in years? wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? wherein neat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
wherein crafty, but in villainy? wherein villainous, but in all things? wherein
worthy, but in nothing?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> I would, your grace would take me with you; whom means
your grace?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> That villainous, abominable mis-leader of youth, Falstaff, that
old white-bearded Satan.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> My lord, the man I know.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> I know thou dost.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> But to say, I know more harm in him than in myself, were to
say more than I know. That he is old (the more the pity) his white hairs
do witness it: but that he is (saving your reverence) a whore-master, that I
utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked! if to be
old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s lean kine are to be loved. No, my
good lord; banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and
therefore more valiant, being as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy
Harry’s company; banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>P. Henry.</em> I do, I will.</p>

<div class='c021'>[<em>Knocking; and Hostess and Bardolph go out.</em></div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><em>Bardolph.</em> O, my lord, my lord; the sheriff, with a most monstrous watch,
is at the door.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> Out, you rogue! play out the play: I have much to say in the
behalf of that Falstaff.’</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most characteristic descriptions of Sir John is that
which Mrs. Quickly gives of him when he asks her ‘What is the
gross sum that I owe thee?’</p>

<p class='c016'>‘<em>Hostess.</em> Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself, and the money too.
Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,
at the round table, by a sea-coal fire on Wednesday in Whitsun-week,
when the prince broke thy head for likening his father to a singing
man of Windsor; thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound,
to marry me, and make me my lady thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did
not goodwife Keech, the butcher’s wife, come in then, and call me gossip
Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar; telling us, she had a
good dish of prawns; whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I
told thee, they were ill for a green wound? And didst thou not, when she
was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor
people; saying, that ere long they should call me madam? And didst thou
not kiss me, and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy
book-oath; deny it, if thou canst.’</p>

<p class='c000'>This scene is to us the most convincing proof of Falstaff’s power of
gaining over the good will of those he was familiar with, except indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Bardolph’s somewhat profane exclamation on hearing the account of
his death, ‘Would I were with him, wheresoe’er he is, whether in
heaven or hell.’</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the topics of exulting superiority over others most common
in Sir John’s mouth is his corpulence and the exterior marks of good
living which he carries about him, thus ‘turning his vices into commodity.’
He accounts for the friendship between the Prince and
Poins, from ‘their legs being both of a bigness’; and compares
Justice Shallow to ‘a man made after supper of a cheese-paring.’
There cannot be a more striking gradation of character than that
between Falstaff and Shallow, and Shallow and Silence. It seems
difficult at first to fall lower than the squire; but this fool, great as he
is, finds an admirer and humble foil in his cousin Silence. Vain of his
acquaintance with Sir John, who makes a butt of him, he exclaims,
‘Would, cousin Silence, that thou had’st seen that which this knight
and I have seen!’—‘Aye, Master Shallow, we have heard the
chimes at midnight,’ says Sir John. To Falstaff’s observation ‘I
did not think Master Silence had been a man of this mettle,’ Silence
answers, ‘Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.’
What an idea is here conveyed of a prodigality of living? What
good husbandry and economical self-denial in his pleasures? What a
stock of lively recollections? It is curious that Shakespear has
ridiculed in Justice Shallow, who was ‘in some authority under the
king,’ that disposition to unmeaning tautology which is the regal
infirmity of later times, and which, it may be supposed, he acquired
from talking to his cousin Silence, and receiving no answers.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘<em>Falstaff.</em> You have here a goodly dwelling, and a rich.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Shallow.</em> Barren, barren, barren; beggars all, beggars all, Sir John:
marry, good air. Spread Davy, spread Davy. Well said, Davy.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Falstaff.</em> This Davy serves you for good uses.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Shallow.</em> A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet. By the mass,
I have drank too much sack at supper. A good varlet. Now sit down,
now sit down. Come, cousin.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The true spirit of humanity, the thorough knowledge of the stuff
we are made of, the practical wisdom with the seeming fooleries in
the whole of the garden-scene at Shallow’s country-seat, and just
before in the exquisite dialogue between him and Silence on the death
of old Double, have no parallel any where else. In one point of view,
they are laughable in the extreme; in another they are equally affecting,
if it is affecting to shew <em>what a little thing is human life</em>, what a
poor forked creature man is!</p>

<p class='c000'>The heroic and serious part of these two plays founded on the story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>of Henry <span class='fss'>IV.</span> is not inferior to the comic and farcical. The characters
of Hotspur and Prince Henry are two of the most beautiful and
dramatic, both in themselves and from contrast, that ever were drawn.
They are the essence of chivalry. We like Hotspur the best upon
the whole, perhaps because he was unfortunate.—The characters of
their fathers, Henry <span class='fss'>IV.</span> and old Northumberland, are kept up equally
well. Henry naturally succeeds by his prudence and caution in
keeping what he has got; Northumberland fails in his enterprise from
an excess of the same quality, and is caught in the web of his own
cold, dilatory policy. Owen Glendower is a masterly character. It
as bold and original as it is intelligible and thoroughly natural. The
disputes between him and Hotspur are managed with infinite address
and insight into nature. We cannot help pointing out here some very
beautiful lines, where Hotspur describes the fight between Glendower
and Mortimer.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>——‘When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank,</div>
      <div class='line'>In single opposition hand to hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>He did confound the best part of an hour</div>
      <div class='line'>In changing hardiment with great Glendower:</div>
      <div class='line'>Three times they breath’d, and three times did they drink,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who then affrighted with their bloody looks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</div>
      <div class='line'>Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The peculiarity and the excellence of Shakespear’s poetry is, that
it seems as if he made his imagination the hand-maid of nature, and
nature the plaything of his imagination. He appears to have been all
the characters, and in all the situations he describes. It is as if either
he had had all their feelings, or had lent them all his genius to express
themselves. There cannot be stronger instances of this than Hotspur’s
rage when Henry <span class='fss'>IV.</span> forbids him to speak of Mortimer, his insensibility
to all that his father and uncle urge to calm him, and his fine abstracted
apostrophe to honour, ‘By heaven methinks it were an easy leap to
pluck bright honour from the moon,’ etc. After all, notwithstanding
the gallantry, generosity, good temper, and idle freaks of the mad-cap
Prince of Wales, we should not have been sorry, if Northumberland’s
force had come up in time to decide the fate of the battle at Shrewsbury;
at least, we always heartily sympathise with Lady Percy’s grief,
when she exclaims,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,</div>
      <div class='line'>To-day might I (hanging on Hotspur’s neck)</div>
      <div class='line'>Have talked of Monmouth’s grave.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>The truth is, that we never could forgive the Prince’s treatment of
Falstaff; though perhaps Shakespear knew what was best, according
to the history, the nature of the times, and of the man. We speak
only as dramatic critics. Whatever terror the French in those days
might have of Henry <span class='fss'>V.</span> yet, to the readers of poetry at present,
Falstaff is the better man of the two. We think of him and quote
him oftener.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>HENRY V.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Henry V.</span> is a very favourite monarch with the English nation, and he
appears to have been also a favourite with Shakespear, who labours
hard to apologise for the actions of the king, by shewing us the
character of the man, as ‘the king of good fellows.’ He scarcely
deserves this honour. He was fond of war and low company:—we
know little else of him. He was careless, dissolute, and ambitious;—idle,
or doing mischief. In private, he seemed to have no idea of the
common decencies of life, which he subjected to a kind of regal
licence; in public affairs, he seemed to have no idea of any rule of
right or wrong, but brute force, glossed over with a little religious
hypocrisy and archiepiscopal advice. His principles did not change
with his situation and professions. His adventure on Gadshill was a
prelude to the affair of Agincourt, only a bloodless one; Falstaff was
a puny prompter of violence and outrage, compared with the pious and
politic Archbishop of Canterbury, who gave the king <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</span></i>, in
a genealogical tree of his family, to rob and murder in circles of latitude
and longitude abroad—to save the possessions of the church at home.
This appears in the speeches in Shakespear, where the hidden motives
that actuate princes and their advisers in war and policy are better laid
open than in speeches from the throne or woolsack. Henry, because
he did not know how to govern his own kingdom, determined to make
war upon his neighbours. Because his own title to the crown was
doubtful, he laid claim to that of France. Because he did not know
how to exercise the enormous power, which had just dropped into his
hands, to any one good purpose, he immediately undertook (a cheap
and obvious resource of sovereignty) to do all the mischief he could.
Even if absolute monarchs had the wit to find out objects of laudable
ambition, they could only ‘plume up their wills’ in adhering to the
more sacred formula of the royal prerogative, ‘the right divine of
kings to govern wrong,’ because will is only then triumphant when it
is opposed to the will of others, because the pride of power is only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>then shewn, not when it consults the rights and interests of others, but
when it insults and tramples on all justice and all humanity. Henry
declares his resolution ‘when France is his, to bend it to his awe, or
break it all to pieces’—a resolution worthy of a conqueror, to destroy
all that he cannot enslave; and what adds to the joke, he lays all the
blame of the consequences of his ambition on those who will not
submit tamely to his tyranny. Such is the history of kingly power,
from the beginning to the end of the world;—with this difference,
that the object of war formerly, when the people adhered to their
allegiance, was to depose kings; the object latterly, since the people
swerved from their allegiance, has been to restore kings, and to make
common cause against mankind. The object of our late invasion
and conquest of France was to restore the legitimate monarch, the
descendant of Hugh Capet, to the throne: Henry <span class='fss'>V.</span> in his time
made war on and deposed the descendant of this very Hugh Capet,
on the plea that he was a usurper and illegitimate. What would the
great modern catspaw of legitimacy and restorer of divine right have
said to the claim of Henry and the title of the descendants of Hugh
Capet? Henry <span class='fss'>V.</span> it is true, was a hero, a King of England, and the
conqueror of the king of France. Yet we feel little love or admiration
for him. He was a hero, that is, he was ready to sacrifice his own
life for the pleasure of destroying thousands of other lives: he was a
king of England, but not a constitutional one, and we only like kings
according to the law; lastly, he was a conqueror of the French king,
and for this we dislike him less than if he had conquered the French
people. How then do we like him? We like him in the play.
There he is a very amiable monster, a very splendid pageant. As we
like to gaze at a panther or a young lion in their cages in the Tower,
and catch a pleasing horror from their glistening eyes, their velvet
paws, and dreadless roar, so we take a very romantic, heroic, patriotic,
and poetical delight in the boasts and feats of our younger Harry, as
they appear on the stage and are confined to lines of ten syllables;
where no blood follows the stroke that wounds our ears, where no
harvest bends beneath horses’ hoofs, no city flames, no little child is
butchered, no dead men’s bodies are found piled on heaps and festering
the next morning—in the orchestra!</p>

<p class='c000'>So much for the politics of this play; now for the poetry. Perhaps
one of the most striking images in all Shakespear is that given of war
in the first lines of the Prologue.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘O for a muse of fire, that would ascend</div>
      <div class='line'>The brightest heaven of invention,</div>
      <div class='line'>A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>Assume the port of Mars, and <em>at his heels</em></div>

<p class='c000'>Rubens, if he had painted it, would not have improved upon this
simile.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conversation between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the
Bishop of Ely, relating to the sudden change in the manners of
Henry <span class='fss'>V.</span> is among the well-known <em>Beauties</em> of Shakespear. It is
indeed admirable both for strength and grace. It has sometimes
occurred to us that Shakespear, in describing ‘the reformation’ of the
Prince, might have had an eye to himself—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>His companies unletter’d, rude and shallow,</div>
      <div class='line'>His hours fill’d up with riots, banquets, sports;</div>
      <div class='line'>And never noted in him any study,</div>
      <div class='line'>Any retirement, any sequestration</div>
      <div class='line'>From open haunts and popularity.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Ely.</em> The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</div>
      <div class='line'>Neighbour’d by fruit of baser quality:</div>
      <div class='line'>And so the prince obscur’d his contemplation</div>
      <div class='line'>Under the veil of wildness, which no doubt</div>
      <div class='line'>Grew like the summer-grass, fastest by night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This at least is as probable an account of the progress of the poet’s
mind as we have met with in any of the Essays on the Learning of
Shakespear.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing can be better managed than the caution which the king
gives the meddling Archbishop, not to advise him rashly to engage in
the war with France, his scrupulous dread of the consequences of that
advice, and his eager desire to hear and follow it.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>We charge you in the name of God, take heed.</div>
      <div class='line'>For never two such kingdoms did contend</div>
      <div class='line'>Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops</div>
      <div class='line'>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Gainst him, whose wrong gives edge unto the swords</div>
      <div class='line'>That make such waste in brief mortality.</div>
      <div class='line'>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;</div>

      <div class='line'>That what you speak, is in your conscience wash’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>As pure as sin with baptism.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another characteristic instance of the blindness of human nature to
every thing but its own interests, is the complaint made by the king of
‘the ill neighbourhood’ of the Scot in attacking England when she
was attacking France.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘For once the eagle England being in prey,</div>
      <div class='line'>To her unguarded nest the weazel Scot</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is worth observing that in all these plays, which give an admirable
picture of the spirit of the <em>good old times</em>, the moral inference
does not at all depend upon the nature of the actions, but on the
dignity or meanness of the persons committing them. ‘The eagle
England’ has a right ‘to be in prey,’ but ‘the weazel Scot’ has
none ‘to come sneaking to her nest,’ which she has left to pounce
upon others. Might was right, without equivocation or disguise, in
that heroic and chivalrous age. The substitution of right for might,
even in theory, is among the refinements and abuses of modern
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A more beautiful rhetorical delineation of the effects of subordination
in a commonwealth can hardly be conceived than the
following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

      <div class='line'>The art of order to a peopled kingdom.</div>
      <div class='line'>They have a king, and officers of sorts:</div>

      <div class='line'>As many lines close in the dial’s centre;</div>
      <div class='line'>So may a thousand actions, once a-foot,</div>
      <div class='line'>End in one purpose, and be all well borne</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Henry V.</span> is but one of Shakespear’s second-rate plays. Yet by
quoting passages, like this, from his second-rate plays alone, we might

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Most of these passages are well known: there is one, which we
do not remember to have seen noticed, and yet it is no whit inferior
to the rest in heroic beauty. It is the account of the deaths of York
and Suffolk.</p>

      <div class='line'>I saw him down; thrice up again, and fighting;</div>

      <div class='line'>The noble earl of Suffolk also lies.</div>
      <div class='line'>Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled o’er,</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes,</div>
      <div class='line'>That bloodily did yawn upon his face;</div>
      <div class='line'>And cries aloud—<em>Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>My soul shall thine keep company to heaven:</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly a-breast;</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>As, in this glorious and well-foughten field,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>We kept together in our chivalry!</em></div>
      <div class='line'>Upon these words I came, and cheer’d him up:</div>
      <div class='line'>He smil’d me in the face, raught me his hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, with a feeble gripe, says—<em>Dear my lord,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Commend my service to my sovereign</em>.</div>
      <div class='line'>So did he turn, and over Suffolk’s neck</div>
      <div class='line'>He threw his wounded arm, and kiss’d his lips;</div>
      <div class='line'>And so, espous’d to death, with blood he seal’d</div>
      <div class='line'>A testament of noble-ending love.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But we must have done with splendid quotations. The behaviour
of the king, in the difficult and doubtful circumstances in which he
is placed, is as patient and modest as it is spirited and lofty in his
prosperous fortune. The character of the French nobles is also very
admirably depicted; and the Dauphin’s praise of his horse shews the
vanity of that class of persons in a very striking point of view.
Shakespear always accompanies a foolish prince with a satirical
courtier, as we see in this instance. The comic parts of <span class='sc'>Henry V.</span>
are very inferior to those of <cite>Henry IV.</cite> Falstaff is dead, and without
him, Pistol, Nym, and Bardolph, are satellites without a sun.
Fluellen the Welchman is the most entertaining character in the
piece. He is good-natured, brave, choleric, and pedantic. His
parallel between Alexander and Harry of Monmouth, and his desire
to have ‘some disputations’ with Captain Macmorris on the discipline
of the Roman wars, in the heat of the battle, are never to be forgotten.
His treatment of Pistol is as good as Pistol’s treatment of
his French prisoner. There are two other remarkable prose passages
in this play: the conversation of Henry in disguise with the three
centinels on the duties of a soldier, and his courtship of Katherine
in broken French. We like them both exceedingly, though the
first savours perhaps too much of the king, and the last too little of
the lover.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>HENRY VI.<br /> <span class='c020'>IN THREE PARTS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>During the time of the civil wars of York and Lancaster, England
was a perfect bear-garden, and Shakespear has given us a very lively
picture of the scene. The three parts of <span class='sc'>Henry VI.</span> convey a picture
of very little else; and are inferior to the other historical plays.
They have brilliant passages; but the general ground-work is comparatively
poor and meagre, the style ‘flat and unraised.’ There are
few lines like the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Glory is like a circle in the water;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The first part relates to the wars in France after the death of
Henry <span class='fss'>V.</span> and the story of the Maid of Orleans. She is here almost
as scurvily treated as in Voltaire’s Pucelle. Talbot is a very
magnificent sketch: there is something as formidable in this portrait
of him, as there would be in a monumental figure of him or in the
sight of the armour which he wore. The scene in which he visits
the Countess of Auvergne, who seeks to entrap him, is a very spirited
one, and his description of his own treatment while a prisoner to the
French not less remarkable.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Salisbury.</em> Yet tell’st thou not how thou wert entertain’d.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Talbot.</em> With scoffs and scorns, and contumelious taunts.</div>
      <div class='line'>In open market-place produced they me,</div>
      <div class='line'>To be a public spectacle to all.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, said they, is the terror of the French,</div>
      <div class='line'>The scarecrow that affrights our children so.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then broke I from the officers that led me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with my nails digg’d stones out of the ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>To hurl at the beholders of my shame.</div>
      <div class='line'>My grisly countenance made others fly,</div>
      <div class='line'>None durst come near for fear of sudden death.</div>
      <div class='line'>In iron walls they deem’d me not secure:</div>
      <div class='line'>So great a fear my name amongst them spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>That they suppos’d I could rend bars of steel,</div>
      <div class='line'>And spurn in pieces posts of adamant.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had:</div>
      <div class='line'>They walk’d about me every minute-while;</div>
      <div class='line'>And if I did but stir out of my bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>The second part relates chiefly to the contests between the nobles
during the minority of Henry, and the death of Gloucester, the good
Duke Humphrey. The character of Cardinal Beaufort is the most
prominent in the group: the account of his death is one of our
author’s master-pieces. So is the speech of Gloucester to the nobles
on the loss of the provinces of France by the King’s marriage with
Margaret of Anjou. The pretensions and growing ambition of the
Duke of York, the father of Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span> are also very ably developed.
Among the episodes, the tragi-comedy of Jack Cade, and the detection
of the impostor Simcox are truly edifying.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third part describes Henry’s loss of his crown: his death
takes place in the last act, which is usually thrust into the common
acting play of <cite>Richard III.</cite> The character of Gloucester, afterwards
King Richard, is here very powerfully commenced, and his
dangerous designs and long-reaching ambition are fully described in
his soliloquy in the third act, beginning, ‘Aye, Edward will use
women honourably.’ Henry <span class='fss'>VI.</span> is drawn as distinctly as his high-spirited
Queen, and notwithstanding the very mean figure which
Henry makes as a King, we still feel more respect for him than for
his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have already observed that Shakespear was scarcely more
remarkable for the force and marked contrasts of his characters than
for the truth and subtlety with which he has distinguished those
which approached the nearest to each other. For instance, the soul
of Othello is hardly more distinct from that of Iago than that of
Desdemona is shewn to be from Æmilia’s; the ambition of Macbeth
is as distinct from the ambition of Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span> as it is from the
meekness of Duncan; the real madness of Lear is as different from
the feigned madness of Edgar<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a> as from the babbling of the fool; the
contrast between wit and folly in Falstaff and Shallow is not more
characteristic though more obvious than the gradations of folly,
loquacious or reserved, in Shallow and Silence; and again, the
gallantry of Prince Henry is as little confounded with that of Hotspur
as with the cowardice of Falstaff, or as the sensual and philosophic
cowardice of the Knight is with the pitiful and cringing cowardice
of Parolles. All these several personages were as different in Shakespear
as they would have been in themselves: his imagination
borrowed from the life, and every circumstance, object, motive,
passion, operated there as it would in reality, and produced a world
of men and women as distinct, as true and as various as those that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>exist in nature. The peculiar property of Shakespear’s imagination
was this truth, accompanied with the unconsciousness of nature:
indeed, imagination to be perfect must be unconscious, at least in
production; for nature is so.—We shall attempt one example more
in the characters of Richard <span class='fss'>II.</span> and Henry <span class='fss'>VI.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>The characters and situations of both these persons were so nearly
alike, that they would have been completely confounded by a common-place
poet. Yet they are kept quite distinct in Shakespear. Both
were kings, and both unfortunate. Both lost their crowns owing to
their mismanagement and imbecility; the one from a thoughtless,
wilful abuse of power, the other from an indifference to it. The
manner in which they bear their misfortunes corresponds exactly to
the causes which led to them. The one is always lamenting the loss
of his power which he has not the spirit to regain; the other seems
only to regret that he had ever been king, and is glad to be rid of
the power, with the trouble; the effeminacy of the one is that of a
voluptuary, proud, revengeful, impatient of contradiction, and inconsolable
in his misfortunes; the effeminacy of the other is that of
an indolent, good-natured mind, naturally averse to the turmoils of
ambition and the cares of greatness, and who wishes to pass his time
in monkish indolence and contemplation.—Richard bewails the loss
of the kingly power only as it was the means of gratifying his pride
and luxury; Henry regards it only as a means of doing right, and
is less desirous of the advantages to be derived from possessing it
than afraid of exercising it wrong. In knighting a young soldier, he
gives him ghostly advice—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Richard <span class='fss'>II.</span> in the first speeches of the play betrays his real
character. In the first alarm of his pride, on hearing of Bolingbroke’s
rebellion, before his presumption has met with any check, he
exclaims—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:</div>
      <div class='line'>This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones</div>
      <div class='line'>Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall faulter under proud rebellious arms.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; &#8196;.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Not all the water in the rough rude sea</div>
      <div class='line'>Can wash the balm from an anointed king;</div>
      <div class='line'>The breath of worldly man cannot depose</div>
      <div class='line'>The Deputy elected by the Lord.</div>
      <div class='line'>For every man that Bolingbroke hath prest,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>To lift sharp steel against our golden crown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven for his Richard hath in heavenly pay</div>
      <div class='line'>A glorious angel; then if angels fight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weak men must fall; for Heaven still guards the right.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Yet, notwithstanding this royal confession of faith, on the very
first news of actual disaster, all his conceit of himself as the peculiar
favourite of Providence vanishes into air.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘But now the blood of twenty thousand men</div>
      <div class='line'>Did triumph in my face, and they are fled.</div>
      <div class='line'>All souls that will be safe fly from my side;</div>
      <div class='line'>For time hath set a blot upon my pride.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Immediately after, however, recollecting that ‘cheap defence’ of
the divinity of kings which is to be found in opinion, he is for arming
his name against his enemies.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Awake, thou coward Majesty, thou sleep’st;</div>
      <div class='line'>Is not the King’s name forty thousand names?</div>
      <div class='line'>Arm, arm, my name: a puny subject strikes</div>
      <div class='line'>At thy great glory.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>King Henry does not make any such vapouring resistance to the
loss of his crown, but lets it slip from off his head as a weight which
he is neither able nor willing to bear; stands quietly by to see the
issue of the contest for his kingdom, as if it were a game at push-pin,
and is pleased when the odds prove against him.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Richard first hears of the death of his favourites, Bushy,
Bagot, and the rest, he indignantly rejects all idea of any further
efforts, and only indulges in the extravagant impatience of his grief
and his despair, in that fine speech which has been so often quoted:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Aumerle.</em> Where is the duke my father, with his power?</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>K. Richard.</em> No matter where: of comfort no man speak:</div>
      <div class='line'>Let’s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Write sorrow in the bosom of the earth!</div>
      <div class='line'>Let’s chuse executors, and talk of wills:</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet not so—for what can we bequeath,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save our deposed bodies to the ground?</div>
      <div class='line'>Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke’s,</div>
      <div class='line'>And nothing can we call our own but death,</div>
      <div class='line'>And that small model of the barren earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.</div>
      <div class='line'>For heaven’s sake let us sit upon the ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tell sad stories of the death of Kings:</div>
      <div class='line'>How some have been depos’d, some slain in war;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Some haunted by the ghosts they dispossess’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some poison’d by their wives, some sleeping kill’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>All murder’d:—for within the hollow crown,</div>
      <div class='line'>That rounds the mortal temples of a king,</div>
      <div class='line'>Keeps death his court: and there the antic sits,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scoffing his state, and grinning at his pomp!</div>
      <div class='line'>Allowing him a breath, a little scene</div>
      <div class='line'>To monarchize, be fear’d, and kill with looks;</div>
      <div class='line'>Infusing him with self and vain conceit—</div>
      <div class='line'>As if this flesh, which walls about our life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were brass impregnable; and, humour’d thus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes at the last, and, with a little pin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bores through his castle wall, and—farewell king!</div>
      <div class='line'>Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood</div>
      <div class='line'>With solemn reverence; throw away respect,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,</div>
      <div class='line'>For you have but mistook me all this while:</div>
      <div class='line'>I live on bread like you, feel want, taste grief,</div>
      <div class='line'>Need friends, like you;—subjected thus,</div>
      <div class='line'>How can you say to me—I am a king?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is as little sincerity afterwards in his affected resignation
to his fate, as there is fortitude in this exaggerated picture of his
misfortunes before they have happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Northumberland comes back with the message from Bolingbroke,
he exclaims, anticipating the result,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What must the king do now? Must he submit?</div>
      <div class='line'>The king shall do it: must he be depos’d?</div>
      <div class='line'>The king shall be contented; must he lose</div>
      <div class='line'>The name of king? O’ God’s name let it go.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll give my jewels for a set of beads;</div>
      <div class='line'>My gorgeous palace for a hermitage;</div>
      <div class='line'>My gay apparel for an alms-man’s gown;</div>
      <div class='line'>My figur’d goblets for a dish of wood;</div>
      <div class='line'>My sceptre for a palmer’s walking staff;</div>
      <div class='line'>My subjects for a pair of carved saints,</div>
      <div class='line'>And my large kingdom for a little grave—</div>
      <div class='line'>A little, little grave, an obscure grave.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How differently is all this expressed in King Henry’s soliloquy,

      <div class='line'>Would I were dead, if God’s good will were so.</div>
      <div class='line'>For what is in this world but grief and woe?</div>
      <div class='line'>O God! methinks it were a happy life</div>
      <div class='line'>To be no better than a homely swain,</div>
      <div class='line'>To sit upon a hill as I do now,</div>

      <div class='line'>Past over, to the end they were created,</div>

      <div class='line'>To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than doth a rich embroidered canopy</div>

      <div class='line'>O yes it doth, a thousand fold it doth.</div>
      <div class='line'>And to conclude, the shepherds’ homely curds,</div>
      <div class='line'>His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,</div>
      <div class='line'>His wonted sleep under a fresh tree’s shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is far beyond a prince’s delicates,</div>
      <div class='line'>His viands sparkling in a golden cup,</div>
      <div class='line'>His body couched in a curious bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>When care, mistrust, and treasons wait on him.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This is a true and beautiful description of a naturally quiet and
contented disposition, and not, like the former, the splenetic effusion
of disappointed ambition.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the last scene of <cite>Richard II.</cite> his despair lends him courage: he
beats the keeper, slays two of his assassins, and dies with imprecations
in his mouth against Sir Pierce Exton, who ‘had staggered his royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>person.’ Henry, when he is seized by the deer-stealers, only reads
them a moral lecture on the duty of allegiance and the sanctity of an
oath; and when stabbed by Gloucester in the tower, reproaches him
with his crimes, but pardons him his own death.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>RICHARD III.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Richard III.</span> may be considered as properly a stage-play: it belongs
to the theatre, rather than to the closet. We shall therefore criticise
it chiefly with a reference to the manner in which we have seen it
performed. It is the character in which Garrick came out: it was
the second character in which Mr. Kean appeared, and in which he
acquired his fame. Shakespear we have always with us: actors we
have only for a few seasons; and therefore some account of them may
be acceptable, if not to our cotemporaries, to those who come after
us, if ‘that rich and idle personage, Posterity,’ should deign to look
into our writings.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is possible to form a higher conception of the character of Richard
than that given by Mr. Kean: but we cannot imagine any character
represented with greater distinctness and precision, more perfectly
<em>articulated</em> in every part. Perhaps indeed there is too much of what is
technically called execution. When we first saw this celebrated actor
in the part, we thought he sometimes failed from an exuberance of
manner, and dissipated the impression of the general character by the
variety of his resources. To be complete, his delineation of it should
have more solidity, depth, sustained and impassioned feeling, with
somewhat less brilliancy, with fewer glancing lights, pointed transitions,
and pantomimic evolutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Richard of Shakespear is towering and lofty; equally impetuous
and commanding; haughty, violent, and subtle; bold and
treacherous; confident in his strength as well as in his cunning; raised
high by his birth, and higher by his talents and his crimes; a royal
usurper, a princely hypocrite, a tyrant, and a murderer of the house of
Plantagenet.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘But I was born so high:</div>
      <div class='line'>Our aery buildeth in the cedar’s top,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The idea conveyed in these lines (which are indeed omitted in the
miserable medley acted for <span class='sc'>Richard III.</span>) is never lost sight of by
Shakespear, and should not be out of the actor’s mind for a moment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>The restless and sanguinary Richard is not a man striving to be great,
but to be greater than he is; conscious of his strength of will, his
power of intellect, his daring courage, his elevated station; and making
use of these advantages to commit unheard-of crimes, and to shield
himself from remorse and infamy.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Mr. Kean does not entirely succeed in concentrating all the lines
of the character, as drawn by Shakespear, he gives an animation,
vigour, and relief to the part which we have not seen equalled. He
is more refined than Cooke; more bold, varied, and original than
Kemble in the same character. In some parts he is deficient in dignity,
and particularly in the scenes of state business, he has by no means an
air of artificial authority. There is at times an aspiring elevation, an
enthusiastic rapture in his expectations of attaining the crown, and
at others a gloating expression of sullen delight, as if he already
clenched the bauble, and held it in his grasp. The courtship scene
with Lady Anne is an admirable exhibition of smooth and smiling
villainy. The progress of wily adulation, of encroaching humility,
is finely marked by his action, voice and eye. He seems, like the
first Tempter, to approach his prey, secure of the event, and as if
success had smoothed his way before him. The late Mr. Cooke’s
manner of representing this scene was more vehement, hurried, and
full of anxious uncertainty. This, though more natural in general,
was less in character in this particular instance. Richard should woo
less as a lover than as an actor—to shew his mental superiority, and
power of making others the playthings of his purposes. Mr. Kean’s
attitude in leaning against the side of the stage before he comes
forward to address Lady Anne, is one of the most graceful and
striking ever witnessed on the stage. It would do for Titian to paint.
The frequent and rapid transition of his voice from the expression of
the fiercest passion to the most familiar tones of conversation was that
which gave a peculiar grace of novelty to his acting on his first
appearance. This has been since imitated and caricatured by others,
and he himself uses the artifice more sparingly than he did. His bye-play
is excellent. His manner of bidding his friends ‘Good night,’
after pausing with the point of his sword, drawn slowly backward and
forward on the ground, as if considering the plan of the battle next
day, is a particularly happy and natural thought. He gives to the
two last acts of the play the greatest animation and effect. He fills
every part of the stage; and makes up for the deficiency of his person
by what has been sometimes objected to as an excess of action. The
concluding scene in which he is killed by Richmond is the most
brilliant of the whole. He fights at last like one drunk with wounds;
and the attitude in which he stands with his hands stretched out, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>his sword is wrested from him, has a preternatural and terrific
grandeur, as if his will could not be disarmed, and the very phantoms
of his despair had power to kill.—Mr. Kean has since in a great
measure effaced the impression of his Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span> by the superior
efforts of his genius in Othello (his master-piece), in the murder-scene
in Macbeth, in Richard <span class='fss'>II.</span>, in Sir Giles Overreach, and lastly in
Oroonoko; but we still like to look back to his first performance of
this part, both because it first assured his admirers of his future success,
and because we bore our feeble but, at that time, not useless testimony
to the merits of this very original actor, on which the town was
considerably divided for no other reason than because they <em>were</em>
original.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner in which Shakespear’s plays have been generally
altered or rather mangled by modern mechanists, is a disgrace to the
English stage. The patch-work <span class='sc'>Richard III.</span> which is acted under
the sanction of his name, and which was manufactured by Cibber, is a
striking example of this remark.</p>

<p class='c000'>The play itself is undoubtedly a very powerful effusion of Shakespear’s
genius. The ground-work of the character of Richard, that
mixture of intellectual vigour with moral depravity, in which Shakespear
delighted to shew his strength—gave full scope as well as
temptation to the exercise of his imagination. The character of his
hero is almost every where predominant, and marks its lurid track
throughout. The original play is however too long for representation,
and there are some few scenes which might be better spared than
preserved, and by omitting which it would remain a complete whole.
The only rule, indeed, for altering Shakespear is to retrench certain
passages which may be considered either as superfluous or obsolete,
but not to add or transpose any thing. The arrangement and developement
of the story, and the mutual contrast and combination of the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</span></i>, are in general as finely managed as the developement
of the characters or the expression of the passions.</p>

<p class='c000'>This rule has not been adhered to in the present instance. Some
of the most important and striking passages in the principal character
have been omitted, to make room for idle and misplaced extracts from
other plays; the only intention of which seems to have been to make
the character of Richard as odious and disgusting as possible. It is
apparently for no other purpose than to make Gloucester stab King
Henry on the stage, that the fine abrupt introduction of the character
in the opening of the play is lost in the tedious whining morality of
the uxorious king (taken from another play);—we say <em>tedious</em>,
because it interrupts the business of the scene, and loses its beauty
and effect by having no intelligible connection with the previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>character of the mild, well-meaning monarch. The passages which
the unfortunate Henry has to recite are beautiful and pathetic in themselves,
but they have nothing to do with the world that Richard has
to ‘bustle in.’ In the same spirit of vulgar caricature is the scene
between Richard and Lady Anne (when his wife) interpolated
without any authority, merely to gratify this favourite propensity to
disgust and loathing. With the same perverse consistency, Richard,
after his last fatal struggle, is raised up by some Galvanic process, to
utter the imprecation, without any motive but pure malignity, which
Shakespear has so properly put into the mouth of Northumberland on
hearing of Percy’s death. To make room for these worse than needless
additions, many of the most striking passages in the real play have
been omitted by the foppery and ignorance of the prompt-book critics.
We do not mean to insist merely on passages which are fine as poetry
and to the reader, such as Clarence’s dream, etc. but on those which
are important to the understanding of the character, and peculiarly
adapted for stage-effect. We will give the following as instances
among several others. The first is the scene where Richard enters
abruptly to the queen and her friends to defend himself:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Gloucester.</em> They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.</div>
      <div class='line'>Who are they that complain unto the king,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I forsooth am stern, and love them not?</div>
      <div class='line'>By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly,</div>
      <div class='line'>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours:</div>
      <div class='line'>Because I cannot flatter and look fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Smile in men’s faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,</div>
      <div class='line'>Duck with French nods, and apish courtesy,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must be held a rancorous enemy.</div>
      <div class='line'>Cannot a plain man live, and think no harm,</div>
      <div class='line'>But thus his simple truth must be abus’d</div>
      <div class='line'>With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Gray.</em> To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Gloucester.</em> To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace;</div>
      <div class='line'>When have I injur’d thee, when done thee wrong?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?</div>
      <div class='line'>A plague upon you all!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nothing can be more characteristic than the turbulent pretensions to
meekness and simplicity in this address. Again, the versatility and
adroitness of Richard is admirably described in the following ironical
conversation with Brakenbury:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Brakenbury.</em> I beseech your graces both to pardon me.</div>
      <div class='line'>His majesty hath straitly given in charge,</div>
      <div class='line'>That no man shall have private conference,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of what degree soever, with your brother.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span><em>Gloucester.</em> E’en so, and please your worship, Brakenbury.</div>
      <div class='line'>You may partake of any thing we say:</div>
      <div class='line'>We speak no treason, man—we say the king</div>
      <div class='line'>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</div>
      <div class='line'>Well strook in years, fair, and not jealous.</div>
      <div class='line'>We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,</div>
      <div class='line'>A cherry lip,</div>
      <div class='line'>A bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</div>
      <div class='line'>That the queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.</div>
      <div class='line'>How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Brakenbury.</em> With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Gloucester.</em> What, fellow, naught to do with mistress Shore?</div>
      <div class='line'>I tell you, sir, he that doth naught with her,</div>
      <div class='line'>Excepting one, were best to do it secretly alone.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Brakenbury.</em> What one, my lord?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Gloucester.</em> Her husband, knave—would’st thou betray me?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The feigned reconciliation of Gloucester with the queen’s kinsmen
is also a master-piece. One of the finest strokes in the play, and which
serves to shew as much as any thing the deep, plausible manners of
Richard, is the unsuspecting security of Hastings, at the very time
when the former is plotting his death, and when that very appearance
of cordiality and good-humour on which Hastings builds his confidence
arises from Richard’s consciousness of having betrayed him to his ruin.
This, with the whole character of Hastings, is omitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the two most beautiful passages in the original play are the
farewell apostrophe of the queen to the Tower, where the children are
shut up from her, and Tyrrel’s description of their death. We will
finish our quotations with them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Queen.</em> Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom envy hath immured within your walls;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rough cradle for such little pretty ones,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rude, rugged nurse, old sullen play-fellow,</div>
      <div class='line'>For tender princes!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The other passage is the account of their death by Tyrrel:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn</div>
      <div class='line'>To do this piece of ruthless butchery,</div>
      <div class='line'>Albeit they were flesh’d villains, bloody dogs,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Melting with tenderness and mild compassion,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wept like to children in their death’s sad story:</div>
      <div class='line'>O thus! quoth Dighton, lay the gentle babes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus, thus, quoth Forrest, girdling one another</div>
      <div class='line'>Within their innocent alabaster arms;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>And in that summer beauty kissed each other;</div>
      <div class='line'>A book of prayers on their pillow lay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which once, quoth Forrest, almost changed my mind:</div>
      <div class='line'>But oh the devil!—there the villain stopped;</div>
      <div class='line'>When Dighton thus told on—we smothered</div>
      <div class='line'>The most replenished sweet work of nature,</div>
      <div class='line'>That from the prime creation ere she framed.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These are some of those wonderful bursts of feeling, done to the
life, to the very height of fancy and nature, which our Shakespear
alone could give. We do not insist on the repetition of these last
passages as proper for the stage: we should indeed be loth to trust
them in the mouth of almost any actor: but we should wish them to
be retained in preference at least to the fantoccini exhibition of the
young princes, Edward and York, bandying childish wit with their
uncle.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>HENRY VIII.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This play contains little action or violence of passion, yet it has
considerable interest of a more mild and thoughtful cast, and some of
the most striking passages in the author’s works. The character of
Queen Katherine is the most perfect delineation of matronly dignity,
sweetness, and resignation, that can be conceived. Her appeals to the
protection of the king, her remonstrances to the cardinals, her conversations
with her women, shew a noble and generous spirit accompanied
with the utmost gentleness of nature. What can be more
affecting than her answer to Campeius and Wolsey, who come to
visit her as pretended friends.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>——‘Nay, forsooth, my friends,</div>
      <div class='line'>They that must weigh out my afflictions,</div>
      <div class='line'>They that my trust must grow to, live not here;</div>
      <div class='line'>They are, as all my comforts are, far hence,</div>
      <div class='line'>In mine own country, lords.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Johnson observes of this play, that ‘the meek sorrows and
virtuous distress of Katherine have furnished some scenes, which may
be justly numbered among the greatest efforts of tragedy. But the
genius of Shakespear comes in and goes out with Katherine. Every
other part may be easily conceived and easily written.’ This is
easily said; but with all due deference to so great a reputed authority
as that of Johnson, it is not true. For instance, the scene of
Buckingham led to execution is one of the most affecting and natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>in Shakespear, and one to which there is hardly an approach in any
other author. Again, the character of Wolsey, the description of his
pride and of his fall, are inimitable, and have, besides their gorgeousness
of effect, a pathos, which only the genius of Shakespear could
lend to the distresses of a proud, bad man, like Wolsey. There is a
sort of child-like simplicity in the very helplessness of his situation,
arising from the recollection of his past overbearing ambition. After
the cutting sarcasms of his enemies on his disgrace, against which he
bears up with a spirit conscious of his own superiority, he breaks out
into that fine apostrophe—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!</div>
      <div class='line'>This is the state of man; to-day he puts forth</div>
      <div class='line'>The tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;</div>
      <div class='line'>The third day comes a frost, a killing frost;</div>
      <div class='line'>And—when he thinks, good easy man, full surely</div>
      <div class='line'>His greatness is a ripening—nips his root,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,</div>
      <div class='line'>These many summers in a sea of glory;</div>
      <div class='line'>But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride</div>
      <div class='line'>At length broke under me; and now has left me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weary and old with service, to the mercy</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.</div>
      <div class='line'>Vain pomp and glory of the world, I hate ye!</div>
      <div class='line'>I feel my heart new open’d: O how wretched</div>
      <div class='line'>Is that poor man, that hangs on princes’ favours!</div>
      <div class='line'>There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,</div>
      <div class='line'>That sweet aspect of princes, and our ruin,</div>
      <div class='line'>More pangs and fears than war and women have;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,</div>
      <div class='line'>Never to hope again!’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is in this passage, as well as in the well-known dialogue with
Cromwell which follows, something which stretches beyond commonplace;
nor is the account which Griffiths gives of Wolsey’s death less
Shakespearian; and the candour with which Queen Katherine listens
to the praise of ‘him whom of all men while living she hated most’
adds the last graceful finishing to her character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among other images of great individual beauty might be mentioned
the description of the effect of Ann Boleyn’s presenting herself to the
crowd at her coronation.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>——‘While her grace sat down</div>
      <div class='line'>To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,</div>
      <div class='line'>In a rich chair of state, opposing freely</div>

      <div class='line'>Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman</div>
      <div class='line'>That ever lay by man. Which when the people</div>
      <div class='line'>Had the full view of, <em>such a noise arose</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>As loud and to as many tunes</em>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The character of Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> is drawn with great truth and spirit.
It is like a very disagreeable portrait, sketched by the hand of a
master. His gross appearance, his blustering demeanour, his vulgarity,
his arrogance, his sensuality, his cruelty, his hypocrisy, his want of
common decency and common humanity, are marked in strong lines.
His traditional peculiarities of expression complete the reality of the
picture. The authoritative expletive, ‘Ha!’ with which he intimates
his indignation or surprise, has an effect like the first startling sound
that breaks from a thunder-cloud. He is of all the monarchs in our
history the most disgusting: for he unites in himself all the vices of
barbarism and refinement, without their virtues. Other kings before
him (such as Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span>) were tyrants and murderers out of ambition
or necessity: they gained or established unjust power by violent
means: they destroyed their enemies, or those who barred their
access to the throne or made its tenure insecure. But Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span>‘s
power is most fatal to those whom he loves: he is cruel and remorseless
to pamper his luxurious appetites: bloody and voluptuous; an
amorous murderer; an uxorious debauchee. His hardened insensibility
to the feelings of others is strengthened by the most profligate
self-indulgence. The religious hypocrisy, under which he masks his
cruelty and his lust, is admirably displayed in the speech in which
he describes the first misgivings of his conscience and its increasing
throes and terrors, which have induced him to divorce his queen.
The only thing in his favour in this play is his treatment of Cranmer:
there is also another circumstance in his favour, which is his patronage
of Hans Holbein.—It has been said of Shakespear—‘No maid could
live near such a man.’ It might with as good reason be said—‘No
king could live near such a man.’ His eye would have penetrated
through the pomp of circumstance and the veil of opinion. As it
is, he has represented such persons to the life—his plays are in this
respect the glass of history—he has done them the same justice as
if he had been a privy counsellor all his life, and in each successive
reign. Kings ought never to be seen upon the stage. In the abstract,
they are very disagreeable characters: it is only while living that they
are ‘the best of kings.’ It is their power, their splendour, it is the
apprehension of the personal consequences of their favour or their
hatred that dazzles the imagination and suspends the judgment of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>favourites or their vassals; but death cancels the bond of allegiance
and of interest; and seen <em>as they were</em>, their power and their pretensions
look monstrous and ridiculous. The charge brought against
modern philosophy as inimical to loyalty is unjust, because it might
as well be brought against other things. No reader of history can
be a lover of kings. We have often wondered that Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> as he
is drawn by Shakespear, and as we have seen him represented in all
the bloated deformity of mind and person, is not hooted from the
English stage.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>KING JOHN</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>King John</span> is the last of the historical plays we shall have to speak
of; and we are not sorry that it is. If we are to indulge our
imaginations, we had rather do it upon an imaginary theme; if we
are to find subjects for the exercise of our pity and terror, we prefer
seeking them in fictitious danger and fictitious distress. It gives a
<em>soreness</em> to our feelings of indignation or sympathy, when we know
that in tracing the progress of sufferings and crimes, we are treading
upon real ground, and recollect that the poet’s dream ‘<em>denoted a foregone
conclusion</em>‘—irrevocable ills, not conjured up by fancy, but placed
beyond the reach of poetical justice. That the treachery of King
John, the death of Arthur, the grief of Constance, had a real truth
in history, sharpens the sense of pain, while it hangs a leaden weight
on the heart and the imagination. Something whispers us that we
have no right to make a mock of calamities like these, or to turn the
truth of things into the puppet and plaything of our fancies. ‘To
consider thus’ may be ‘to consider too curiously’; but still we think
that the actual truth of the particular events, in proportion as we are
conscious of it, is a drawback on the pleasure as well as the dignity
of tragedy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>King John</span> has all the beauties of language and all the richness of
the imagination to relieve the painfulness of the subject. The character
of King John himself is kept pretty much in the background;
it is only marked in by comparatively slight indications. The crimes
he is tempted to commit are such as are thrust upon him rather by
circumstances and opportunity than of his own seeking: he is here
represented as more cowardly than cruel, and as more contemptible
than odious. The play embraces only a part of his history. There
are however few characters on the stage that excite more disgust and
loathing. He has no intellectual grandeur or strength of character
to shield him from the indignation which his immediate conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>provokes: he stands naked and defenceless, in that respect, to the
worst we can think of him: and besides, we are impelled to put
the very worst construction on his meanness and cruelty by the tender
picture of the beauty and helplessness of the object of it, as well as
by the frantic and heart-rending pleadings of maternal despair. We
do not forgive him the death of Arthur, because he had too late
revoked his doom and tried to prevent it; and perhaps because he
has himself repented of his black design, our <em>moral sense</em> gains courage
to hate him the more for it. We take him at his word, and think
his purposes must be odious indeed, when he himself shrinks back
from them. The scene in which King John suggests to Hubert the
design of murdering his nephew is a master-piece of dramatic skill,
but it is still inferior, very inferior to the scene between Hubert and
Arthur, when the latter learns the orders to put out his eyes. If
any thing ever was penned, heart-piercing, mixing the extremes of
terror and pity, of that which shocks and that which soothes the
mind, it is this scene. We will give it entire, though perhaps it is
tasking the reader’s sympathy too much.</p>

<p class='c000'>His death afterwards, when he throws himself from his prison
walls, excites the utmost pity for his innocence and friendless situation,
and well justifies the exaggerated denunciations of Falconbridge to
Hubert, whom he suspects wrongfully of the deed.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell</div>
      <div class='line'>As thou shalt be, if thou did’st kill this child.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The excess of maternal tenderness, rendered desperate by the
fickleness of friends and the injustice of fortune, and made stronger
in will, in proportion to the want of all other power, was never more
finely expressed than in Constance. The dignity of her answer to
King Philip, when she refuses to accompany his messenger, ‘To me
and to the state of my great grief, let kings assemble,’ her indignant
reproach to Austria for deserting her cause, her invocation to death,
‘that love of misery,’ however fine and spirited, all yield to the beauty
of the passage, where, her passion subsiding into tenderness, she
addresses the Cardinal in these words:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh father Cardinal, I have heard you say</div>
      <div class='line'>That we shall see and know our friends in heav’n:</div>
      <div class='line'>If that be, I shall see my boy again,</div>
      <div class='line'>For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,</div>
      <div class='line'>To him that did but yesterday suspire,</div>
      <div class='line'>There was not such a gracious creature born.</div>
      <div class='line'>But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud,</div>
      <div class='line'>And chase the native beauty from his cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he will look as hollow as a ghost,</div>
      <div class='line'>As dim and meagre as an ague’s fit,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so he’ll die; and rising so again,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>When I shall meet him in the court of heav’n,</div>
      <div class='line'>I shall not know him; therefore never, never</div>
      <div class='line'>Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>K. Philip.</em> You are as fond of grief as of your child.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Constance.</em> Grief fills the room up of my absent child:</div>
      <div class='line'>Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me;</div>
      <div class='line'>Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,</div>
      <div class='line'>Remembers me of all his gracious parts;</div>
      <div class='line'>Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then have I reason to be fond of grief.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The contrast between the mild resignation of Queen Katherine to her
own wrongs, and the wild, uncontroulable affliction of Constance
for the wrongs which she sustains as a mother, is no less naturally
conceived than it is ably sustained throughout these two wonderful
characters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The accompaniment of the comic character of the Bastard was
well chosen to relieve the poignant agony of suffering, and the cold
cowardly policy of behaviour in the principal characters of this play.
Its spirit, invention, volubility of tongue and forwardness in action,
are unbounded. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aliquando sufflaminandus erat</span></i>, says Ben Jonson of
Shakespear. But we should be sorry if Ben Jonson had been his
licenser. We prefer the heedless magnanimity of his wit infinitely
to all Jonson’s laborious caution. The character of the Bastard’s
comic humour is the same in essence as that of other comic characters
in Shakespear; they always run on with good things and are never
exhausted; they are always daring and successful. They have words
at will, and a flow of wit like a flow of animal spirits. The difference
between Falconbridge and the others is that he is a soldier, and
brings his wit to bear upon action, is courageous with his sword as
well as tongue, and stimulates his gallantry by his jokes, his enemies
feeling the sharpness of his blows and the sting of his sarcasms at the
same time. Among his happiest sallies are his descanting on the
composition of his own person, his invective against ‘commodity,
tickling commodity,’ and his expression of contempt for the Archduke
of Austria, who had killed his father, which begins in jest but
ends in serious earnest. His conduct at the siege of Angiers shews
that his resources were not confined to verbal retorts.—The same
exposure of the policy of courts and camps, of kings, nobles, priests,
and cardinals, takes place here as in the other plays we have gone
through, and we shall not go into a disgusting repetition.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, like the other plays taken from English history, is written
in a remarkably smooth and flowing style, very different from some
of the tragedies, <cite>Macbeth</cite>, for instance. The passages consist of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>series of single lines, not running into one another. This peculiarity
in the versification, which is most common in the three parts of
<cite>Henry VI.</cite> has been assigned as a reason why those plays were not
written by Shakespear. But the same structure of verse occurs in
his other undoubted plays, as in <cite>Richard II.</cite> and in <span class='sc'>King John</span>.
The following are instances:—</p>

      <div class='line'>‘That daughter there of Spain, the lady Blanch,</div>

      <div class='line'>If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?</div>
      <div class='line'>If zealous love should go in search of virtue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?</div>

  <h3 class='c010'>TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This is justly considered as one of the most delightful of Shakespear’s
comedies. It is full of sweetness and pleasantry. It is perhaps too
good-natured for comedy. It has little satire, and no spleen. It
aims at the ludicrous rather than the ridiculous. It makes us laugh
at the follies of mankind, not despise them, and still less bear any
ill-will towards them. Shakespear’s comic genius resembles the bee
rather in its power of extracting sweets from weeds or poisons, than
in leaving a sting behind it. He gives the most amusing exaggeration
of the prevailing foibles of his characters, but in a way that they
themselves, instead of being offended at, would almost join in to
humour; he rather contrives opportunities for them to shew themselves
off in the happiest lights, than renders them contemptible in
the perverse construction of the wit or malice of others.—There is
a certain stage of society in which people become conscious of their
peculiarities and absurdities, affect to disguise what they are, and set
up pretensions to what they are not. This gives rise to a corresponding
style of comedy, the object of which is to detect the disguises
of self-love, and to make reprisals on these preposterous assumptions
of vanity, by marking the contrast between the real and the affected
character as severely as possible, and denying to those, who would
impose on us for what they are not, even the merit which they have.
This is the comedy of artificial life, of wit and satire, such as we
see it in Congreve, Wycherley, Vanbrugh, etc. To this succeeds
a state of society from which the same sort of affectation and pretence
are banished by a greater knowledge of the world or by their successful
exposure on the stage; and which by neutralising the materials
of comic character, both natural and artificial, leaves no comedy at
all—but <em>the sentimental</em>. Such is our modern comedy. There is a
period in the progress of manners anterior to both these, in which
the foibles and follies of individuals are of nature’s planting, not the
growth of art or study; in which they are therefore unconscious of
them themselves, or care not who knows them, if they can but have
their whim out; and in which, as there is no attempt at imposition,
the spectators rather receive pleasure from humouring the inclinations
of the persons they laugh at, than wish to give them pain by exposing
their absurdity. This may be called the comedy of nature, and it is
the comedy which we generally find in Shakespear.—Whether the
analysis here given be just or not, the spirit of his comedies is evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>quite distinct from that of the authors above mentioned, as it is in its
essence the same with that of Cervantes, and also very frequently of
Molière, though he was more systematic in his extravagance than
Shakespear. Shakespear’s comedy is of a pastoral and poetical cast.
Folly is indigenous to the soil, and shoots out with native, happy,
unchecked luxuriance. Absurdity has every encouragement afforded
it; and nonsense has room to flourish in. Nothing is stunted by the
churlish, icy hand of indifference or severity. The poet runs riot in
a conceit, and idolises a quibble. His whole object is to turn the
meanest or rudest objects to a pleasurable account. The relish which
he has of a pun, or of the quaint humour of a low character, does not
interfere with the delight with which he describes a beautiful image,
or the most refined love. The clown’s forced jests do not spoil the
sweetness of the character of Viola; the same house is big enough to
hold Malvolio, the Countess, Maria, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew
Ague-cheek. For instance, nothing can fall much lower than this
last character in intellect or morals: yet how are his weaknesses
nursed and dandled by Sir Toby into something ‘high fantastical,’
when on Sir Andrew’s commendation of himself for dancing and
fencing, Sir Toby answers—‘Wherefore are these things hid?
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before them? Are they like to
take dust like mistress Moll’s picture? Why dost thou not go to
church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk
should be a jig! I would not so much as make water but in a
cinque-pace. What dost thou mean? Is this a world to hide virtues
in? I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was
framed under the star of a galliard!’—How Sir Toby, Sir Andrew,
and the Clown afterwards <em>chirp over their cups</em>, how they ‘rouse the
night-owl in a catch, able to draw three souls out of one weaver!’
What can be better than Sir Toby’s unanswerable answer to Malvolio,
‘Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more
cakes and ale?’—In a word, the best turn is given to every thing,
instead of the worst. There is a constant infusion of the romantic
and enthusiastic, in proportion as the characters are natural and
sincere: whereas, in the more artificial style of comedy, every thing
gives way to ridicule and indifference, there being nothing left but
affectation on one side, and incredulity on the other.—Much as we
like Shakespear’s comedies, we cannot agree with Dr. Johnson that
they are better than his tragedies; nor do we like them half so well.
If his inclination to comedy sometimes led him to trifle with the
seriousness of tragedy, the poetical and impassioned passages are the
best parts of his comedies. The great and secret charm of <span class='sc'>Twelfth
Night</span> is the character of Viola. Much as we like catches and cakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>and ale, there is something that we like better. We have a friendship
for Sir Toby; we patronise Sir Andrew; we have an understanding
with the Clown, a sneaking kindness for Maria and her rogueries; we
feel a regard for Malvolio, and sympathise with his gravity, his smiles,
his cross garters, his yellow stockings, and imprisonment in the stocks.
But there is something that excites in us a stronger feeling than all
this—it is Viola’s confession of her love.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespear alone could describe the effect of his own poetry.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh, it came o’er the ear like the sweet south</div>

      <div class='line'>Stealing and giving odour.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>What we so much admire here is not the image of Patience on a
monument, which has been generally quoted, but the lines before and
after it. ‘They give a very echo to the seat where love is throned.’
How long ago it is since we first learnt to repeat them; and still, still
they vibrate on the heart, like the sounds which the passing wind
draws from the trembling strings of a harp left on some desert shore!
There are other passages of not less impassioned sweetness. Such is
Olivia’s address to Sebastian, whom she supposes to have already
deceived her in a promise of marriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who after this will say that Shakespear’s genius was only fitted for
comedy? Yet after reading other parts of this play, and particularly
the garden-scene where Malvolio picks up the letter, if we were to
say that his genius for comedy was less than his genius for tragedy,
it would perhaps only prove that our own taste in such matters is more
saturnine than mercurial.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Malvolio.</em> Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him;

<p class='c016'><em>Malvolio.</em> Saying—Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your

<p class='c016'><em>Sir Toby.</em> What, what?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>The letter and his comments on it are equally good. If poor
Malvolio’s treatment afterwards is a little hard, poetical justice is done
in the uneasiness which Olivia suffers on account of her mistaken
attachment to Cesario, as her insensibility to the violence of the
Duke’s passion is atoned for by the discovery of Viola’s concealed
love of him.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA</h3>

<p class='c011'>This is little more than the first outlines of a comedy loosely sketched
in. It is the story of a novel dramatised with very little labour or
pretension; yet there are passages of high poetical spirit, and of
inimitable quaintness of humour, which are undoubtedly Shakespear’s,
and there is throughout the conduct of the fable a careless grace and
felicity which marks it for his. One of the editors (we believe Mr.
Pope) remarks in a marginal note to the <span class='sc'>Two Gentlemen of Verona</span>—</p>

<p class='c016'>‘It is observable (I know not for what cause) that the style of this
comedy is less figurative, and more natural and unaffected than the greater
part of this author’s, though supposed to be one of the first he wrote.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet so little does the editor appear to have made up his mind upon
this subject, that we find the following note to the very next (the
second) scene.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘This whole scene, like many others in these plays (some of which I
believe were written by Shakespear, and others interpolated by the players)
is composed of the lowest and most trifling conceits, to be accounted for
only by the gross taste of the age he lived in: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populo ut placerent</span></i>. I wish
I had authority to leave them out, but I have done all I could, set a mark
of reprobation upon them, throughout this edition.’</p>

<p class='c000'>It is strange that our fastidious critic should fall so soon from praising
to reprobating. The style of the familiar parts of this comedy is
indeed made up of conceits—low they may be for what we know,
but then they are not poor, but rich ones. The scene of Launce
with his dog (not that in the second, but that in the fourth act) is a
perfect treat in the way of farcical drollery and invention; nor do
we think Speed’s manner of proving his master to be in love deficient
in wit or sense, though the style may be criticised as not simple
enough for the modern taste.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘<em>Valentine.</em> Why, how know you that I am in love?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Speed.</em> Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like
Sir Protheus, to wreathe your arms like a malcontent, to relish a love-song
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>like a robin-red-breast, to walk alone like one that had the pestilence, to
sigh like a school-boy that had lost his ABC, to weep like a young wench
that had buried her grandam, to fast like one that takes diet, to watch like
one that fears robbing, to speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas. You
were wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked, to
walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner;
when you looked sadly, it was for want of money; and now you are metamorphosed
with a mistress, that when I look on you, I can hardly think
you my master.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The tender scenes in this play, though not so highly wrought as in
some others, have often much sweetness of sentiment and expression.
There is something pretty and playful in the conversation of Julia
with her maid, when she shews such a disposition to coquetry about
receiving the letter from Protheus; and her behaviour afterwards and
her disappointment, when she finds him faithless to his vows, remind
us at a distance of Imogen’s tender constancy. Her answer to
Lucetta, who advises her against following her lover in disguise, is a
beautiful piece of poetry.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>THE MERCHANT OF VENICE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This is a play that in spite of the change of manners and prejudices
still holds undisputed possession of the stage. Shakespear’s malignant
has outlived Mr. Cumberland’s benevolent Jew. In proportion as
Shylock has ceased to be a popular bugbear, ‘baited with the rabble’s
curse,’ he becomes a half-favourite with the philosophical part of the
audience, who are disposed to think that Jewish revenge is at least as
good as Christian injuries. Shylock is <em>a good hater</em>; ‘a man no less
sinned against than sinning.’ If he carries his revenge too far, yet
he has strong grounds for ‘the lodged hate he bears Anthonio,’ which
he explains with equal force of eloquence and reason. He seems the
depositary of the vengeance of his race; and though the long habit of
brooding over daily insults and injuries has crusted over his temper
with inveterate misanthropy, and hardened him against the contempt
of mankind, this adds but little to the triumphant pretensions of his
enemies. There is a strong, quick, and deep sense of justice mixed
up with the gall and bitterness of his resentment. The constant
apprehension of being burnt alive, plundered, banished, reviled, and
trampled on, might be supposed to sour the most forbearing nature,
and to take something from that ‘milk of human kindness,’ with
which his persecutors contemplated his indignities. The desire of
revenge is almost inseparable from the sense of wrong; and we can
hardly help sympathising with the proud spirit, hid beneath his
‘Jewish gaberdine,’ stung to madness by repeated undeserved provocations,
and labouring to throw off the load of obloquy and
oppression heaped upon him and all his tribe by one desperate act of
‘lawful’ revenge, till the ferociousness of the means by which he is
to execute his purpose, and the pertinacity with which he adheres to
it, turn us against him; but even at last, when disappointed of the
sanguinary revenge with which he had glutted his hopes, and exposed
to beggary and contempt by the letter of the law on which he had
insisted with so little remorse, we pity him, and think him hardly
dealt with by his judges. In all his answers and retorts upon his
adversaries, he has the best not only of the argument but of the question,
reasoning on their own principles and practice. They are so far
from allowing of any measure of equal dealing, of common justice or
humanity between themselves and the Jew, that even when they come
to ask a favour of him, and Shylock reminds them that ‘on such a
day they spit upon him, another spurned him, another called him dog,
and for these curtesies request he’ll lend them so much monies’—Anthonio,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>his old enemy, instead of any acknowledgment of the
shrewdness and justice of his remonstrance, which would have been
preposterous in a respectable Catholic merchant in those times,
threatens him with a repetition of the same treatment—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I am as like to call thee so again,</div>
      <div class='line'>To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>After this, the appeal to the Jew’s mercy, as if there were any
common principle of right and wrong between them, is the rankest
hypocrisy, or the blindest prejudice; and the Jew’s answer to one of
Anthonio’s friends, who asks him what his pound of forfeit flesh is
good for, is irresistible—</p>

<p class='c016'>To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge.
He hath disgrac’d me, and hinder’d me of half a million, laughed at my
losses, mock’d at my gains, scorn’d my nation, thwarted my bargains,
cool’d my friends, heated mine enemies; and what’s his reason? I am
a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes; hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,
senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same
weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
and cooled by the same winter and summer that a Christian is? If you
prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you
poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?
If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew
wrong a Christian, what is his humility? revenge. If a Christian wrong
a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? why revenge.
The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will
better the instruction.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole of the trial-scene, both before and after the entrance of
Portia, is a master-piece of dramatic skill. The legal acuteness, the
passionate declamations, the sound maxims of jurisprudence, the wit
and irony interspersed in it, the fluctuations of hope and fear in the
different persons, and the completeness and suddenness of the catastrophe,
cannot be surpassed. Shylock, who is his own counsel,
defends himself well, and is triumphant on all the general topics that
are urged against him, and only fails through a legal flaw. Take the
following as an instance:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Shylock.</em> What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?</div>
      <div class='line'>You have among you many a purchas’d slave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which like your asses, and your dogs, and mules,</div>
      <div class='line'>You use in abject and in slavish part,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because you bought them:—shall I say to you,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why sweat they under burdens? let their beds</div>
      <div class='line'>Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Be season’d with such viands? you will answer,</div>
      <div class='line'>The slaves are ours:—so do I answer you:</div>
      <div class='line'>The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is dearly bought, is mine, and I will have it:</div>
      <div class='line'>If you deny me, fie upon your law!</div>
      <div class='line'>There is no force in the decrees of Venice:</div>
      <div class='line'>I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The keenness of his revenge awakes all his faculties; and he beats
back all opposition to his purpose, whether grave or gay, whether of
wit or argument, with an equal degree of earnestness and self-possession.
His character is displayed as distinctly in other less
prominent parts of the play, and we may collect from a few sentences
the history of his life—his descent and origin, his thrift and domestic
economy, his affection for his daughter, whom he loves next to his
wealth, his courtship and his first present to Leah, his wife! ‘I
would not have parted with it’ (the ring which he first gave her)
‘for a wilderness of monkies!’ What a fine Hebraism is implied in
this expression!</p>

<p class='c000'>Portia is not a very great favourite with us; neither are we in love
with her maid, Nerissa. Portia has a certain degree of affectation
and pedantry about her, which is very unusual in Shakespear’s
women, but which perhaps was a proper qualification for the office
of a ‘civil doctor,’ which she undertakes and executes so successfully.
The speech about Mercy is very well; but there are a thousand finer
ones in Shakespear. We do not admire the scene of the caskets:
and object entirely to the Black Prince, Morocchius. We should
like Jessica better if she had not deceived and robbed her father, and
Lorenzo, if he had not married a Jewess, though he thinks he
has a right to wrong a Jew. The dialogue between this newly-married
couple by moonlight, beginning ‘On such a night,’ etc. is a
collection of classical elegancies. Launcelot, the Jew’s man, is an
honest fellow. The dilemma in which he describes himself placed
between his ‘conscience and the fiend,’ the one of which advises him
to run away from his master’s service and the other to stay in it, is
exquisitely humourous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gratiano is a very admirable subordinate character. He is the
jester of the piece: yet one speech of his, in his own defence, contains
a whole volume of wisdom.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Anthonio.</em> I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,</div>
      <div class='line'>A stage, where every one must play his part;</div>
      <div class='line'>And mine a sad one.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Gratiano.</em> Let me play the fool:</div>
      <div class='line'>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>And let my liver rather heat with wine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</div>

      <div class='line'>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</div>
      <div class='line'>Sleep when he wakes? and creep into the jaundice</div>
      <div class='line'>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Anthonio—</div>
      <div class='line'>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks;—</div>
      <div class='line'>There are a sort of men, whose visages</div>
      <div class='line'>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond:</div>
      <div class='line'>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</div>
      <div class='line'>With purpose to be drest in an opinion</div>
      <div class='line'>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;</div>
      <div class='line'>As who should say, <em>I am Sir Oracle,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark</em>!</div>
      <div class='line'>O, my Anthonio, I do know of these,</div>
      <div class='line'>That therefore only are reputed wise,</div>
      <div class='line'>For saying nothing; who, I am very sure,</div>
      <div class='line'>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which hearing them, would call their brothers, fools.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll tell thee more of this another time:</div>
      <div class='line'>But fish not with this melancholy bait,</div>
      <div class='line'>For this fool’s gudgeon, this opinion,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Gratiano’s speech on the philosophy of love, and the effect of habit
in taking off the force of passion, is as full of spirit and good sense.
The graceful winding up of this play in the fifth act, after the tragic
business is despatched, is one of the happiest instances of Shakespear’s
knowledge of the principles of the drama. We do not mean the
pretended quarrel between Portia and Nerissa and their husbands
about the rings, which is amusing enough, but the conversation just
before and after the return of Portia to her own house, beginning
‘How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank,’ and ending ‘Peace!
how the moon sleeps with Endymion, and would not be awaked.’
There is a number of beautiful thoughts crowded into that short
space, and linked together by the most natural transitions.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we first went to see Mr. Kean in Shylock, we expected to
see, what we had been used to see, a decrepid old man, bent with
age and ugly with mental deformity, grinning with deadly malice,
with the venom of his heart congealed in the expression of his countenance,
sullen, morose, gloomy, inflexible, brooding over one idea,
that of his hatred, and fixed on one unalterable purpose, that of his
revenge. We were disappointed, because we had taken our idea from
other actors, not from the play. There is no proof there that
Shylock is old, but a single line, ‘Bassanio and <em>old</em> Shylock, both
stand forth,’—which does not imply that he is infirm with age—and
the circumstance that he has a daughter marriageable, which does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>not imply that he is old at all. It would be too much to say that
his body should be made crooked and deformed to answer to his
mind, which is bowed down and warped with prejudices and passion.
That he has but one idea, is not true; he has more ideas than any
other person in the piece; and if he is intense and inveterate in the
pursuit of his purpose, he shews the utmost elasticity, vigour, and
presence of mind, in the means of attaining it. But so rooted was
our habitual impression of the part from seeing it caricatured in the
representation, that it was only from a careful perusal of the play itself
that we saw our error. The stage is not in general the best place to
study our author’s characters in. It is too often filled with traditional
common-place conceptions of the part, handed down from sire to son,
and suited to the taste of <em>the great vulgar and the small</em>.—‘’Tis an
unweeded garden: things rank and gross do merely gender in it!’
If a man of genius comes once in an age to clear away the rubbish,
to make it fruitful and wholesome, they cry, ‘’Tis a bad school: it
may be like nature, it may be like Shakespear, but it is not like us.’
Admirable critics!</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE WINTER’S TALE</h3>

<p class='c011'>We wonder that Mr. Pope should have entertained doubts of the
genuineness of this play. He was, we suppose, shocked (as a certain
critic suggests) at the Chorus, Time, leaping over sixteen years with
his crutch between the third and fourth act, and at Antigonus’s
landing with the infant Perdita on the sea-coast of Bohemia. These
slips or blemishes however do not prove it not to be Shakespear’s;
for he was as likely to fall into them as any body; but we do not
know any body but himself who could produce the beauties. The
<em>stuff</em> of which the tragic passion is composed, the romantic sweetness,
the comic humour, are evidently his. Even the crabbed and
tortuous style of the speeches of Leontes, reasoning on his own
jealousy, beset with doubts and fears, and entangled more and more
in the thorny labyrinth, bears every mark of Shakespear’s peculiar
manner of conveying the painful struggle of different thoughts and
feelings, labouring for utterance, and almost strangled in the birth.
For instance:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Ha’ not you seen, Camillo?</div>
      <div class='line'>(But that’s past doubt; you have, or your eye-glass</div>
      <div class='line'>Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn) or heard,</div>
      <div class='line'>(For to a vision so apparent, rumour</div>
      <div class='line'>Cannot be mute) or thought (for cogitation</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Resides not within man that does not think)</div>
      <div class='line'>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt, confess,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or else be impudently negative,</div>
      <div class='line'>To have nor eyes, nor ears, nor thought.’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Here Leontes is confounded with his passion, and does not know
which way to turn himself, to give words to the anguish, rage, and
apprehension, which tug at his breast. It is only as he is worked up
into a clearer conviction of his wrongs by insisting on the grounds of
his unjust suspicions to Camillo, who irritates him by his opposition,
that he bursts out into the following vehement strain of bitter indignation:
yet even here his passion staggers, and is as it were oppressed
with its own intensity.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Is whispering nothing?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?</div>
      <div class='line'>Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career</div>
      <div class='line'>Of laughter with a sigh? (a note infallible</div>
      <div class='line'>Of breaking honesty!) horsing foot on foot?</div>
      <div class='line'>Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?</div>
      <div class='line'>Hours, minutes? the noon, midnight? and all eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Blind with the pin and web, but theirs; theirs only,</div>
      <div class='line'>That would, unseen, be wicked? is this nothing?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why then the world, and all that’s in’t, is nothing,</div>
      <div class='line'>The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia’s nothing,</div>
      <div class='line'>My wife is nothing!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The character of Hermione is as much distinguished by its saintlike
resignation and patient forbearance, as that of Paulina is by her
zealous and spirited remonstrances against the injustice done to the
queen, and by her devoted attachment to her misfortunes. Hermione’s
restoration to her husband and her child, after her long
separation from them, is as affecting in itself as it is striking in the
representation. Camillo, and the old shepherd and his son, are
subordinate but not uninteresting instruments in the developement of
the plot, and though last, not least, comes Autolycus, a very pleasant,
thriving rogue; and (what is the best feather in the cap of all knavery)
he escapes with impunity in the end.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The Winter’s Tale</span> is one of the best-acting of our author’s plays.
We remember seeing it with great pleasure many years ago. It was
on the night that King took leave of the stage, when he and Mrs.
Jordan played together in the after-piece of the Wedding-day.
Nothing could go off with more <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i>, with more spirit, and grandeur
of effect. Mrs. Siddons played Hermione, and in the last scene
acted the painted statue to the life—with true monumental dignity
and noble passion; Mr. Kemble, in Leontes, worked himself up into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>a very fine classical phrensy; and Bannister, as Autolycus, roared as
loud for pity as a sturdy beggar could do who felt none of the pain
he counterfeited, and was sound of wind and limb. We shall never
see these parts so acted again; or if we did, it would be in vain.
Actors grow old, or no longer surprise us by their novelty. But true
poetry, like nature, is always young; and we still read the courtship
of Florizel and Perdita, as we welcome the return of spring, with the
same feelings as ever.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This delicious scene is interrupted by the father of the prince discovering
himself to Florizel, and haughtily breaking off the intended
match between his son and Perdita. When Polixenes goes out,
Perdita says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Even here undone:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As Perdita, the supposed shepherdess, turns out to be the daughter of
Hermione, and a princess in disguise, both feelings of the pride of
birth and the claims of nature are satisfied by the fortunate event
of the story, and the fine romance of poetry is reconciled to the
strictest court-etiquette.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ALL’S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>All’s Well that Ends Well</span> is one of the most pleasing of our
author’s comedies. The interest is however more of a serious than of a
comic nature. The character of Helen is one of great sweetness and
delicacy. She is placed in circumstances of the most critical kind,
and has to court her husband both as a virgin and a wife: yet the
most scrupulous nicety of female modesty is not once violated. There
is not one thought or action that ought to bring a blush into her
cheeks, or that for a moment lessens her in our esteem. Perhaps the
romantic attachment of a beautiful and virtuous girl to one placed
above her hopes by the circumstances of birth and fortune, was never
so exquisitely expressed as in the reflections which she utters when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>young Roussillon leaves his mother’s house, under whose protection she
has been brought up with him, to repair to the French king’s court.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Helena.</em> Oh, were that all—I think not on my father,</div>
      <div class='line'>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</div>
      <div class='line'>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</div>
      <div class='line'>I have forgot him. My imagination</div>
      <div class='line'>Carries no favour in it, but Bertram’s.</div>
      <div class='line'>I am undone, there is no living, none</div>
      <div class='line'>If Bertram be away. It were all one</div>
      <div class='line'>That I should love a bright particular star,</div>
      <div class='line'>And think to wed it; he is so above me:</div>
      <div class='line'>In his bright radiance and collateral light</div>
      <div class='line'>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ ambition in my love thus plagues itself;</div>
      <div class='line'>The hind that would be mated by the lion,</div>
      <div class='line'>Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, tho’ a plague,</div>
      <div class='line'>To see him every hour, to sit and draw</div>
      <div class='line'>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls</div>
      <div class='line'>In our heart’s table: heart too capable</div>
      <div class='line'>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.</div>
      <div class='line'>But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy</div>
      <div class='line'>Must sanctify his relics.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The interest excited by this beautiful picture of a fond and innocent
heart is kept up afterwards by her resolution to follow him to France,
the success of her experiment in restoring the king’s health, her demanding
Bertram in marriage as a recompense, his leaving her in
disdain, her interview with him afterwards disguised as Diana, a
young lady whom he importunes with his secret addresses, and their
final reconciliation when the consequences of her stratagem and the
proofs of her love are fully made known. The persevering gratitude
of the French king to his benefactress, who cures him of a languishing
distemper by a prescription hereditary in her family, the indulgent
kindness of the Countess, whose pride of birth yields, almost without
a struggle, to her affection for Helen, the honesty and uprightness of
the good old lord Lafeu, make very interesting parts of the picture.
The wilful stubbornness and youthful petulance of Bertram are also
very admirably described. The comic part of the play turns on the
folly, boasting, and cowardice of Parolles, a parasite and hanger-on
of Bertram’s, the detection of whose false pretensions to bravery and
honour forms a very amusing episode. He is first found out by the
old lord Lafeu, who says, ‘The soul of this man is in his clothes’;
and it is proved afterwards that his heart is in his tongue, and that
both are false and hollow. The adventure of ‘the bringing off of his
drum’ has become proverbial as a satire on all ridiculous and blustering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>undertakings which the person never means to perform: nor can
any thing be more severe than what one of the bye-standers remarks
upon what Parolles says of himself, ‘Is it possible he should know
what he is, and be that he is?’ Yet Parolles himself gives the best
solution of the difficulty afterwards when he is thankful to escape
with his life and the loss of character; for, so that he can live on,
he is by no means squeamish about the loss of pretensions, to which
he had sense enough to know he had no real claim, and which he
had assumed only as a means to live.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Parolles.</em> Yet I am thankful: if my heart were great,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft</div>
      <div class='line'>As captain shall. Simply the thing I am</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall make me live: who knows himself a braggart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let him fear this; for it shall come to pass,</div>
      <div class='line'>That every braggart shall be found an ass.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rust sword, cool blushes, and Parolles live</div>
      <div class='line'>Safest in shame; being fool’d, by fool’ry thrive;</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s place and means for every man alive.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll after them.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The story of <span class='sc'>All’s Well that Ends Well</span>, and of several others of
Shakespear’s plays, is taken from Boccacio. The poet has dramatised
the original novel with great skill and comic spirit, and has preserved
all the beauty of character and sentiment without <em>improving upon</em> it,
which was impossible. There is indeed in Boccacio’s serious pieces
a truth, a pathos, and an exquisite refinement of sentiment, which is
hardly to be met with in any other prose writer whatever. Justice
has not been done him by the world. He has in general passed for
a mere narrator of lascivious tales or idle jests. This character
probably originated in his obnoxious attacks on the monks, and has
been kept up by the grossness of mankind, who revenged their own
want of refinement on Boccacio, and only saw in his writings what
suited the coarseness of their own tastes. But the truth is, that he
has carried sentiment of every kind to its very highest purity and
perfection. By sentiment we would here understand the habitual
workings of some one powerful feeling, where the heart reposes
almost entirely upon itself, without the violent excitement of opposing
duties or untoward circumstances. In this way, nothing ever came
up to the story of Frederigo Alberigi and his Falcon. The perseverance
in attachment, the spirit of gallantry and generosity displayed
in it, has no parallel in the history of heroical sacrifices. The
feeling is so unconscious too, and involuntary, is brought out in such
small, unlooked-for, and unostentatious circumstances, as to show it to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>have been woven into the very nature and soul of the author. The
story of Isabella is scarcely less fine, and is more affecting in the
circumstances and in the catastrophe. Dryden has done justice to
the impassioned eloquence of the Tancred and Sigismunda; but has
not given an adequate idea of the wild preternatural interest of the
story of Honoria. Cimon and Iphigene is by no means one of the
best, notwithstanding the popularity of the subject. The proof of
unalterable affection given in the story of Jeronymo, and the simple
touches of nature and picturesque beauty in the story of the two
holiday lovers, who were poisoned by tasting of a leaf in the garden
at Florence, are perfect master-pieces. The epithet of Divine was
well bestowed on this great painter of the human heart. The invention
implied in his different tales is immense: but we are not to
infer that it is all his own. He probably availed himself of all the
common traditions which were floating in his time, and which he was
the first to appropriate. Homer appears the most original of all
authors—probably for no other reason than that we can trace the
plagiarism no farther. Boccacio has furnished subjects to numberless
writers since his time, both dramatic and narrative. The story of
Griselda is borrowed from his Decameron by Chaucer; as is the
Knight’s Tale (Palamon and Arcite) from his poem of the Theseid.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>LOVE’S LABOUR’S LOST</h3>

<p class='c011'>If we were to part with any of the author’s comedies, it should be
this. Yet we should be loth to part with Don Adriano de Armado,
that mighty potentate of nonsense, or his page, that handful of wit;
with Nathaniel the curate, or Holofernes the schoolmaster, and their
dispute after dinner on ‘the golden cadences of poesy’; with Costard
the clown, or Dull the constable. Biron is too accomplished a
character to be lost to the world, and yet he could not appear without
his fellow courtiers and the king: and if we were to leave out
the ladies, the gentlemen would have no mistresses. So that we
believe we may let the whole play stand as it is, and we shall hardly
venture to ‘set a mark of reprobation on it.’ Still we have some
objections to the style, which we think savours more of the pedantic
spirit of Shakespear’s time than of his own genius; more of controversial
divinity, and the logic of Peter Lombard, than of the
inspiration of the Muse. It transports us quite as much to the
manners of the court, and the quirks of courts of law, as to the scenes
of nature or the fairy-land of his own imagination. Shakespear has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>set himself to imitate the tone of polite conversation then prevailing
among the fair, the witty, and the learned, and he has imitated it but
too faithfully. It is as if the hand of Titian had been employed to
give grace to the curls of a full-bottomed periwig, or Raphael had
attempted to give expression to the tapestry figures in the House of
Lords. Shakespear has put an excellent description of this fashionable
jargon into the mouth of the critical Holofernes ‘as too picked,
too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate, as I may
call it’; and nothing can be more marked than the difference when
he breaks loose from the trammels he had imposed on himself, ‘as
light as bird from brake,’ and speaks in his own person. We think,
for instance, that in the following soliloquy the poet has fairly got the
start of Queen Elizabeth and her maids of honour:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

      <div class='line'>‘<em>Biron.</em> O! and I forsooth in love,</div>

      <div class='line'>Than whom no mortal more magnificent.</div>

      <div class='line'>Nay, to be perjur’d, which is worst of all:</div>
      <div class='line'>And among three to love the worst of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,</div>

      <div class='line'>That Cupid will impose for my neglect</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>The character of Biron drawn by Rosaline and that which Biron
gives of Boyet are equally happy. The observations on the use and
abuse of study, and on the power of beauty to quicken the understanding
as well as the senses, are excellent. The scene which has
the greatest dramatic effect is that in which Biron, the king,
Longaville, and Dumain, successively detect each other and are
detected in their breach of their vow and in their profession of
attachment to their several mistresses, in which they suppose themselves
to be overheard by no one. The reconciliation between these
lovers and their sweethearts is also very good, and the penance which
Rosaline imposes on Biron, before he can expect to gain her consent
to marry him, full of propriety and beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>This admirable comedy used to be frequently acted till of late years.
Mr. Garrick’s Benedick was one of his most celebrated characters;
and Mrs. Jordan, we have understood, played Beatrice very delightfully.
The serious part is still the most prominent here, as in other
instances that we have noticed. Hero is the principal figure in the
piece, and leaves an indelible impression on the mind by her beauty,
her tenderness, and the hard trial of her love. The passage in which
Claudio first makes a confession of his affection towards her, conveys
as pleasing an image of the entrance of love into a youthful bosom as
can well be imagined.</p>

simplicity.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>The justification of Hero in the end, and her restoration to the
confidence and arms of her lover, is brought about by one of those
temporary consignments to the grave of which Shakespear seems to
have been fond. He has perhaps explained the theory of this
predilection in the following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Friar.</em> She dying, as it must be so maintain’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the instant that she was accus’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall be lamented, pity’d, and excus’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of every hearer: for it so falls out,</div>
      <div class='line'>That what we have we prize not to the worth,</div>
      <div class='line'>While we enjoy it; but being lack’d and lost,</div>
      <div class='line'>Why then we rack the value; then we find</div>
      <div class='line'>The virtue, that possession would not shew us</div>
      <div class='line'>Whilst it was ours.—So will it fare with Claudio;</div>
      <div class='line'>When he shall hear she dy’d upon his words,</div>
      <div class='line'>The idea of her love shall sweetly creep</div>
      <div class='line'>Into his study of imagination;</div>
      <div class='line'>And every lovely organ of her life</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall come apparel’d in more precious habit,</div>
      <div class='line'>More moving, delicate, and full of life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than when she liv’d indeed.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The principal comic characters in <span class='sc'>Much Ado about Nothing</span>,
Benedick and Beatrice, are both essences in their kind. His
character as a woman-hater is admirably supported, and his conversion
to matrimony is no less happily effected by the pretended story of
Beatrice’s love for him. It is hard to say which of the two scenes
is the best, that of the trick which is thus practised on Benedick, or
that in which Beatrice is prevailed on to take pity on him by overhearing
her cousin and her maid declare (which they do on purpose)
that he is dying of love for her. There is something delightfully
picturesque in the manner in which Beatrice is described as coming to
hear the plot which is contrived against herself—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs</div>
      <div class='line'>Close by the ground, to hear our conference.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In consequence of what she hears (not a word of which is true) she
exclaims when these good-natured informants are gone,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Stand I condemn’d for pride and scorn so much?</div>
      <div class='line'>Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride adieu!</div>
      <div class='line in4'>No glory lives behind the back of such.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>And, Benedick, love on, I will requite thee;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand;</div>
      <div class='line'>If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To bind our loves up in an holy band:</div>
      <div class='line'>For others say thou dost deserve; and I</div>
      <div class='line'>Believe it better than reportingly.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Benedick, on his part, is equally sincere in his repentance with
equal reason, after he has heard the grey-beard, Leonato, and his
friend, ‘Monsieur Love,’ discourse of the desperate state of his
supposed inamorata.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘This can be no trick; the conference was sadly borne.—They have the
truth of this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady; it seems her
affections have the full bent. Love me! why, it must be requited. I
hear how I am censur’d: they say, I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
the love come from her; they say too, that she will rather die than give
any sign of affection.—I did never think to marry: I must not seem
proud:—happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to
mending. They say, the lady is fair; ’tis a truth, I can bear them witness:
and virtuous;—’tis so, I cannot reprove it: and wise—but for loving me:—by
my troth it is no addition to her wit;—nor no great argument of
her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her.—I may chance to have
some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have rail’d
so long against marriage: but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves
the meat in his youth, that he cannot endure in his age.—Shall quips, and
sentences, and these paper bullets of the brain, awe a man from the career
of his humour? No: the world must be peopled. When I said, I would
die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were marry’d.—Here
comes Beatrice: by this day, she’s a fair lady: I do spy some marks of
love in her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The beauty of all this arises from the characters of the persons so
entrapped. Benedick is a professed and staunch enemy to marriage,
and gives very plausible reasons for the faith that is in him. And as
to Beatrice, she persecutes him all day with her jests (so that he
could hardly think of being troubled with them at night) she not only
turns him but all other things into jest, and is proof against everything
serious.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Hero.</em> Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</div>

      <div class='line'>All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,</div>

      <div class='line'>She’d swear the gentleman should be her sister;</div>
      <div class='line'>If black, why, nature, drawing of an antick,</div>
      <div class='line'>Made a foul blot: if tall, a lance ill-headed;</div>
      <div class='line'>If low, an agate very vilely cut:</div>

      <div class='line'>And never gives to truth and virtue that</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These were happy materials for Shakespear to work on, and he
has made a happy use of them. Perhaps that middle point of comedy
was never more nicely hit in which the ludicrous blends with the
tender, and our follies, turning round against themselves in support of
our affections, retain nothing but their humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dogberry and Verges in this play are inimitable specimens of quaint
blundering and misprisions of meaning; and are a standing record of
that formal gravity of pretension and total want of common understanding,
which Shakespear no doubt copied from real life, and which
in the course of two hundred years appear to have ascended from the
lowest to the highest offices in the state.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>AS YOU LIKE IT</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Shakespear</span> has here converted the forest of Arden into another
Arcadia, where they ‘fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the
golden world.’ It is the most ideal of any of this author’s plays.
It is a pastoral drama, in which the interest arises more out of the
sentiments and characters than out of the actions or situations. It is
not what is done, but what is said, that claims our attention. Nursed
in solitude, ‘under the shade of melancholy boughs,’ the imagination
grows soft and delicate, and the wit runs riot in idleness, like a
spoiled child, that is never sent to school. Caprice and fancy reign
and revel here, and stern necessity is banished to the court. The
mild sentiments of humanity are strengthened with thought and
leisure; the echo of the cares and noise of the world strikes upon
the ear of those ‘who have felt them knowingly,’ softened by time
and distance. ‘They hear the tumult, and are still.’ The very air
of the place seems to breathe a spirit of philosophical poetry: to stir
the thoughts, to touch the heart with pity, as the drowsy forest rustles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>to the sighing gale. Never was there such beautiful moralising,
equally free from pedantry or petulance.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And this their life, exempt from public haunts,</div>
      <div class='line'>Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Jaques is the only purely contemplative character in Shakespear.
He thinks, and does nothing. His whole occupation is to amuse his
mind, and he is totally regardless of his body and his fortunes. He
is the prince of philosophical idlers; his only passion is thought;
he sets no value upon any thing but as it serves as food for reflection.
He can ‘suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs’;
the motley fool, ‘who morals on the time,’ is the greatest prize he
meets with in the forest. He resents Orlando’s passion for Rosalind
as some disparagement of his own passion for abstract truth; and
leaves the Duke, as soon as he is restored to his sovereignty, to seek
his brother out who has quitted it, and turned hermit.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>—‘Out of these convertites</div>
      <div class='line'>There is much matter to be heard and learnt.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Within the sequestered and romantic glades of the forest of Arden,
they find leisure to be good and wise, or to play the fool and fall in
love. Rosalind’s character is made up of sportive gaiety and natural
tenderness: her tongue runs the faster to conceal the pressure at her
heart. She talks herself out of breath, only to get deeper in love.
The coquetry with which she plays with her lover in the double
character which she has to support is managed with the nicest
address. How full of voluble, laughing grace is all her conversation
with Orlando—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>—‘In heedless mazes running</div>
      <div class='line'>With wanton haste and giddy cunning.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How full of real fondness and pretended cruelty is her answer to
him when he promises to love her ‘For ever and a day!’</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Say a day without the ever: no, no, Orlando, men are April when they
woo, December when they wed: maids are May when they are maids,
but the sky changes when they are wives: I will be more jealous of thee
than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen; more clamorous than a parrot
against rain; more new-fangled than an ape; more giddy in my desires
than a monkey; I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain, and
I will do that when you are disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a
hyen, and that when you are inclined to sleep.</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Orlando.</em> But will my Rosalind do so?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Rosalind.</em> By my life she will do as I do.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>The silent and retired character of Celia is a necessary relief to
the provoking loquacity of Rosalind, nor can anything be better
conceived or more beautifully described than the mutual affection
between the two cousins:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>—‘We still have slept together,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose at an instant, learn’d, play’d, eat together,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wheresoe’r we went, like Juno’s swans,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still we went coupled and inseparable.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The unrequited love of Silvius for Phebe shews the perversity of
this passion in the commonest scenes of life, and the rubs and stops
which nature throws in its way, where fortune has placed none.
Touchstone is not in love, but he will have a mistress as a subject
for the exercise of his grotesque humour, and to shew his contempt
for the passion, by his indifference about the person. He is a rare
fellow. He is a mixture of the ancient cynic philosopher with the
modern buffoon, and turns folly into wit, and wit into folly, just as
the fit takes him. His courtship of Audrey not only throws a
degree of ridicule on the state of wedlock itself, but he is equally an
enemy to the prejudices of opinion in other respects. The lofty
tone of enthusiasm, which the Duke and his companions in exile spread
over the stillness and solitude of a country life, receives a pleasant shock
from Touchstone’s sceptical determination of the question.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘<em>Corin.</em> And how like you this shepherd’s life, Mr. Touchstone?</p>

<p class='c016'><em>Clown.</em> Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in
respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect that it is
solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very
vile life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you,
it fits my humour; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
against my stomach.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Zimmerman’s celebrated work on Solitude discovers only <em>half</em> the
sense of this passage.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is hardly any of Shakespear’s plays that contains a greater
number of passages that have been quoted in books of extracts, or a
greater number of phrases that have become in a manner proverbial.
If we were to give all the striking passages, we should give half the
play. We will only recall a few of the most delightful to the reader’s
recollection. Such are the meeting between Orlando and Adam,
the exquisite appeal of Orlando to the humanity of the Duke and his
company to supply him with food for the old man, and their answer,
the Duke’s description of a country life, and the account of Jaques
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>moralising on the wounded deer, his meeting with Touchstone in the
forest, his apology for his own melancholy and his satirical vein, and
the well-known speech on the stages of human life, the old song of
‘Blow, blow, thou winter’s wind,’ Rosalind’s description of the
marks of a lover and of the progress of time with different persons,
the picture of the snake wreathed round Oliver’s neck while the
lioness watches her sleeping prey, and Touchstone’s lecture to the
shepherd, his defence of cuckolds, and panegyric on the virtues of
‘an If.’—All of these are familiar to the reader: there is one
passage of equal delicacy and beauty which may have escaped him,
and with it we shall close our account of <span class='sc'>As You Like It</span>. It is
Phebe’s description of Ganimed at the end of the third act.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Think not I love him, tho’ I ask for him;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis but a peevish boy, yet he talks well;—</div>
      <div class='line'>But what care I for words! yet words do well,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he that speaks them pleases those that hear:</div>

      <div class='line'>But sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him;</div>
      <div class='line'>He’ll make a proper man; the best thing in him</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>THE TAMING OF THE SHREW</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Taming of the Shrew</span> is almost the only one of Shakespear’s
comedies that has a regular plot, and downright moral. It is full of
bustle, animation, and rapidity of action. It shews admirably how
self-will is only to be got the better of by stronger will, and how one
degree of ridiculous perversity is only to be driven out by another
still greater. Petruchio is a madman in his senses; a very honest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>fellow, who hardly speaks a word of truth, and succeeds in all his
tricks and impostures. He acts his assumed character to the life,
with the most fantastical extravagance, with complete presence of
mind, with untired animal spirits, and without a particle of ill humour
from beginning to end.—The situation of poor Katherine, worn out
by his incessant persecutions, becomes at last almost as pitiable as it
is ludicrous, and it is difficult to say which to admire most, the unaccountableness
of his actions, or the unalterableness of his resolutions.
It is a character which most husbands ought to study, unless perhaps
the very audacity of Petruchio’s attempt might alarm them more than
his success would encourage them. What a sound must the following
speech carry to some married ears!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Think you a little din can daunt my ears?</div>
      <div class='line'>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?</div>
      <div class='line'>Have I not heard the sea, puff’d up with winds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rage like an angry boar, chafed with sweat?</div>
      <div class='line'>Have I not heard great ordnance in the field?</div>
      <div class='line'>And heav’n’s artillery thunder in the skies?</div>
      <div class='line'>Have I not in a pitched battle heard</div>
      <div class='line'>Loud larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets clang?</div>
      <div class='line'>And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,</div>
      <div class='line'>That gives not half so great a blow to hear,</div>
      <div class='line'>As will a chesnut in a farmer’s fire?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Not all Petruchio’s rhetoric would persuade more than ‘some
dozen followers’ to be of this heretical way of thinking. He unfolds
his scheme for the <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite>, on a principle of contradiction,
thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I’ll woo her with some spirit when she comes.</div>
      <div class='line'>Say that she rail, why then I’ll tell her plain</div>
      <div class='line'>She sings as sweetly as a nightingale;</div>
      <div class='line'>Say that she frown, I’ll say she looks as clear</div>
      <div class='line'>As morning roses newly wash’d with dew;</div>
      <div class='line'>Say she be mute, and will not speak a word,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then I’ll commend her volubility,</div>
      <div class='line'>And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:</div>
      <div class='line'>If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks,</div>
      <div class='line'>As though she bid me stay by her a week;</div>
      <div class='line'>If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>When I shall ask the banns, and when be married?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He accordingly gains her consent to the match, by telling her father
that he has got it; disappoints her by not returning at the time he
has promised to wed her, and when he returns, creates no small consternation
by the oddity of his dress and equipage. This, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>is nothing to the astonishment excited by his mad-brained behaviour
at the marriage. Here is the account of it by an eye-witness:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Gremio.</em> Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to him:</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll tell you, Sir Lucentio; when the priest</div>
      <div class='line'>Should ask if Katherine should be his wife?</div>
      <div class='line'>Ay, by gogs woons, quoth he; and swore so loud,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, all amaz’d, the priest let fall the book;</div>
      <div class='line'>And as he stooped again to take it up,</div>
      <div class='line'>This mad-brain’d bridegroom took him such a cuff,</div>
      <div class='line'>That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now take them up, quoth he, if any list.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Tranio.</em> What said the wench when he rose up again?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Gremio.</em> Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp’d and swore,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if the vicar meant to cozen him.</div>
      <div class='line'>But after many ceremonies done,</div>
      <div class='line'>He calls for wine; a health, quoth he; as if</div>
      <div class='line'>He’ad been aboard carousing with his mates</div>
      <div class='line'>After a storm; quaft off the muscadel,</div>
      <div class='line'>And threw the sops all in the sexton’s face;</div>
      <div class='line'>Having no other cause but that his beard</div>
      <div class='line'>Grew thin and hungerly, and seem’d to ask</div>
      <div class='line'>His sops as he was drinking. This done, he took</div>
      <div class='line'>The bride about the neck, and kiss’d her lips</div>
      <div class='line'>With such a clamourous smack, that at their parting</div>
      <div class='line'>All the church echoed: and I seeing this,</div>
      <div class='line'>Came thence for very shame; and after me,</div>
      <div class='line'>I know, the rout is coming;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Such a mad marriage never was before.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The most striking and at the same time laughable feature in the
character of Petruchio throughout, is the studied approximation to
the intractable character of real madness, his apparent insensibility to
all external considerations, and utter indifference to every thing but
the wild and extravagant freaks of his own self-will. There is no
contending with a person on whom nothing makes any impression but
his own purposes, and who is bent on his own whims just in proportion
as they seem to want common sense. With him a thing’s being
plain and reasonable is a reason against it. The airs he gives himself
are infinite, and his caprices as sudden as they are groundless. The
whole of his treatment of his wife at home is in the same spirit of
ironical attention and inverted gallantry. Every thing flies before
his will, like a conjuror’s wand, and he only metamorphoses his
wife’s temper by metamorphosing her senses and all the objects she
sees, at a word’s speaking. Such are his insisting that it is the moon
and not the sun which they see, etc. This extravagance reaches its
most pleasant and poetical height in the scene where, on their return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>to her father’s, they meet old Vincentio, whom Petruchio immediately
addresses as a young lady:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Petruchio.</em> Good morrow, gentle mistress, where away?</div>
      <div class='line'>Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?</div>
      <div class='line'>Such war of white and red within her cheeks;</div>
      <div class='line'>What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,</div>
      <div class='line'>As those two eyes become that heav’nly face?</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee:</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty’s sake.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Hortensio.</em> He’ll make the man mad to make a woman of him.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Katherine.</em> Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whither away, or where is thy abode?</div>
      <div class='line'>Happy the parents of so fair a child;</div>
      <div class='line'>Happier the man whom favourable stars</div>
      <div class='line'>Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Petruchio.</em> Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad:</div>
      <div class='line'>This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not a maiden, as thou say’st he is.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Katherine.</em> Pardon, old father, my mistaken eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>That have been so bedazed with the sun</div>
      <div class='line'>That everything I look on seemeth green.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The whole is carried off with equal spirit, as if the poet’s comic
Muse had wings of fire. It is strange how one man could be so
many things; but so it is. The concluding scene, in which trial is
made of the obedience of the new-married wives (so triumphantly for
Petruchio) is a very happy one.—In some parts of this play there
is a little too much about music-masters and masters of philosophy.
They were things of greater rarity in those days than they are now.
Nothing however can be better than the advice which Tranio gives
his master for the prosecution of his studies:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The mathematics, and the metaphysics,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you:</div>
      <div class='line'>No profit grows, where is no pleasure ta’en:</div>
      <div class='line'>In brief, sir, study what you most affect.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We have heard the <cite>Honey-Moon</cite> called ‘an elegant Katherine and
Petruchio.’ We suspect we do not understand this word <em>elegant</em> in
the sense that many people do. But in our sense of the word, we
should call Lucentio’s description of his mistress elegant.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with her breath she did perfume the air:</div>
      <div class='line'>Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>When Biondello tells the same Lucentio for his encouragement, ‘I
knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for
parsley to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir’—there is nothing
elegant in this, and yet we hardly know which of the two passages is
the best.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The Taming of the Shrew</span> is a play within a play. It is supposed
to be a play acted for the benefit of Sly the tinker, who is made to
believe himself a lord, when he wakes after a drunken brawl. The
character of Sly and the remarks with which he accompanies the play
are as good as the play itself. His answer when he is asked how
he likes it, ‘Indifferent well; ’tis a good piece of work, would ‘twere
done,’ is in good keeping, as if he were thinking of his Saturday
night’s job. Sly does not change his tastes with his new situation,
but in the midst of splendour and luxury still calls out lustily and
repeatedly ‘for a pot o’ the smallest ale.’ He is very slow in giving
up his personal identity in his sudden advancement.—‘I am Christophero
Sly, call not me honour nor lordship. I ne’er drank sack
in my life: and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
beef: ne’er ask me what raiment I’ll wear, for I have no more
doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes
than feet, nay, sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
toes look through the over-leather.—What, would you make me
mad? Am not I Christophero Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton-heath,
by birth a pedlar, by education a card-maker, by transmutation a
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask Marian
Hacket, the fat alewife of Wincot, if she know me not; if she say
I am not fourteen-pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for
the lying’st knave in Christendom.’</p>

<p class='c000'>This is honest. ‘The Slies are no rogues,’ as he says of himself.
We have a great predilection for this representative of the family;
and what makes us like him the better is, that we take him to be of
kin (not many degrees removed) to Sancho Panza.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>MEASURE FOR MEASURE</h3>

<p class='c011'>This is a play as full of genius as it is of wisdom. Yet there is an
original sin in the nature of the subject, which prevents us from
taking a cordial interest in it. ‘The height of moral argument’
which the author has maintained in the intervals of passion or blended
with the more powerful impulses of nature, is hardly surpassed in any
of his plays. But there is in general a want of passion; the affections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>are at a stand; our sympathies are repulsed and defeated in all
directions. The only passion which influences the story is that of
Angelo; and yet he seems to have a much greater passion for
hypocrisy than for his mistress. Neither are we greatly enamoured
of Isabella’s rigid chastity, though she could not act otherwise than
she did. We do not feel the same confidence in the virtue that is
‘sublimely good’ at another’s expense, as if it had been put to some
less disinterested trial. As to the Duke, who makes a very imposing
and mysterious stage-character, he is more absorbed in his own
plots and gravity than anxious for the welfare of the state; more
tenacious of his own character than attentive to the feelings and
apprehensions of others. Claudio is the only person who feels
naturally; and yet he is placed in circumstances of distress which
almost preclude the wish for his deliverance. Mariana is also in
love with Angelo, whom we hate. In this respect, there may be
said to be a general system of cross-purposes between the feelings
of the different characters and the sympathy of the reader or the
audience. This principle of repugnance seems to have reached its
height in the character of Master Barnardine, who not only sets at
defiance the opinions of others, but has even thrown off all self-regard,—‘one
that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a
drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless of what’s past, present,
and to come.’ He is a fine antithesis to the morality and the hypocrisy
of the other characters of the play. Barnardine is Caliban
transported from Prospero’s wizard island to the forests of Bohemia
or the prisons of Vienna. He is the creature of bad habits as Caliban
is of gross instincts. He has however a strong notion of the natural
fitness of things, according to his own sensations—‘He has been
drinking hard all night, and he will not be hanged that day’—and
Shakespear has let him off at last. We do not understand why the
philosophical German critic, Schlegel, should be so severe on those
pleasant persons, Lucio, Pompey, and Master Froth, as to call them
‘wretches.’ They appear all mighty comfortable in their occupations,
and determined to pursue them, ‘as the flesh and fortune should
serve.’ A very good exposure of the want of self-knowledge and
contempt for others, which is so common in the world, is put into
the mouth of Abhorson, the jailor, when the Provost proposes to
associate Pompey with him in his office—‘A bawd, sir? Fie upon
him, he will discredit our mystery.’ And the same answer will
serve in nine instances out of ten to the same kind of remark, ‘Go
to, sir, you weigh equally; a feather will turn the scale.’ Shakespear
was in one sense the least moral of all writers; for morality
(commonly so called) is made up of antipathies; and his talent consisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>in sympathy with human nature, in all its shapes, degrees,
depressions, and elevations. The object of the pedantic moralist
is to find out the bad in everything: his was to shew that ‘there
is some soul of goodness in things evil.’ Even Master Barnardine
is not left to the mercy of what others think of him; but when he
comes in, speaks for himself, and pleads his own cause, as well as if
counsel had been assigned him. In one sense, Shakespear was no
moralist at all: in another, he was the greatest of all moralists. He
was a moralist in the same sense in which nature is one. He taught
what he had learnt from her. He shewed the greatest knowledge
of humanity with the greatest fellow-feeling for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most dramatic passages in the present play is the interview
between Claudio and his sister, when she comes to inform him
of the conditions on which Angelo will spare his life.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> is no doubt a very amusing play, with
a great deal of humour, character, and nature in it: but we should
have liked it much better, if any one else had been the hero of it,
instead of Falstaff. We could have been contented if Shakespear
had not been ‘commanded to shew the knight in love.’ Wits and
philosophers, for the most part, do not shine in that character; and
Sir John himself, by no means, comes off with flying colours. Many
people complain of the degradation and insults to which Don Quixote
is so frequently exposed in his various adventures. But what are
the unconscious indignities which he suffers, compared with the
sensible mortifications which Falstaff is made to bring upon himself?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>What are the blows and buffetings which the Don receives from
the staves of the Yanguesian carriers or from Sancho Panza’s more
hard-hearted hands, compared with the contamination of the buck-basket,
the disguise of the fat woman of Brentford, and the horns of
Herne the hunter, which are discovered on Sir John’s head? In
reading the play, we indeed wish him well through all these discomfitures,
but it would have been as well if he had not got into
them. Falstaff in the <span class='sc'>Merry Wives of Windsor</span> is not the man he
was in the two parts of <cite>Henry IV.</cite> His wit and eloquence have
left him. Instead of making a butt of others, he is made a butt of
by them. Neither is there a single particle of love in him to excuse
his follies: he is merely a designing, bare-faced knave, and an unsuccessful
one. The scene with Ford as Master Brook, and that
with Simple, Slender’s man, who comes to ask after the Wise Woman,
are almost the only ones in which his old intellectual ascendancy
appears. He is like a person recalled to the stage to perform an
unaccustomed and ungracious part; and in which we perceive only
‘some faint sparks of those flashes of merriment, that were wont to
set the hearers in a roar.’ But the single scene with Doll Tearsheet,
or Mrs. Quickly’s account of his desiring ‘to eat some of
housewife Reach’s prawns,’ and telling her ‘to be no more so
familiarity with such people,’ is worth the whole of the <span class='sc'>Merry
Wives of Windsor</span> put together. Ford’s jealousy, which is the main
spring of the comic incidents, is certainly very well managed. Page,
on the contrary, appears to be somewhat uxorious in his disposition;
and we have pretty plain indications of the effect of the characters
of the husbands on the different degrees of fidelity in their wives.
Mrs. Quickly makes a very lively go-between, both between Falstaff
and his Dulcineas, and Anne Page and her lovers, and seems in the
latter case so intent on her own interest as totally to overlook the
intentions of her employers. Her master, Dr. Caius, the Frenchman,
and her fellow-servant Jack Rugby, are very completely described.
This last-mentioned person is rather quaintly commended
by Mrs. Quickly as ‘an honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant
shall come in house withal, and I warrant you, no tell-tale, nor no
breed-bate; his worst fault is, that he is given to prayer; he is
something peevish that way; but nobody but has his fault.’ The
Welch Parson, Sir Hugh Evans (a title which in those days was
given to the clergy) is an excellent character in all respects. He
is as respectable as he is laughable. He has ‘very good discretions,
and very odd humours.’ The duel-scene with Caius gives him an
opportunity to shew his ‘cholers and his tremblings of mind,’ his
valour and his melancholy, in an irresistible manner. In the dialogue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>which at his mother’s request he holds with his pupil, William Page,
to shew his progress in learning, it is hard to say whether the simplicity
of the master or the scholar is the greatest. Nym, Bardolph,
and Pistol, are but the shadows of what they were; and Justice
Shallow himself has little of his consequence left. But his cousin,
Slender, makes up for the deficiency. He is a very potent piece
of imbecility. In him the pretensions of the worthy Gloucestershire
family are well kept up, and immortalised. He and his friend
Sackerson and his book of songs and his love of Anne Page and his
having nothing to say to her can never be forgotten. It is the only
first-rate character in the play: but it is in that class. Shakespear
is the only writer who was as great in describing weakness as strength.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE COMEDY OF ERRORS</h3>

<p class='c011'>This comedy is taken very much from the Menæchmi of Plautus,
and is not an improvement on it. Shakespear appears to have
bestowed no great pains on it, and there are but a few passages
which bear the decided stamp of his genius. He seems to have
relied on his author, and on the interest arising out of the intricacy
of the plot. The curiosity excited is certainly very considerable,
though not of the most pleasing kind. We are teazed as with a
riddle, which notwithstanding we try to solve. In reading the play,
from the sameness of the names of the two Antipholises and the two
Dromios, as well from their being constantly taken for each other
by those who see them, it is difficult, without a painful effort of
attention, to keep the characters distinct in the mind. And again,
on the stage, either the complete similarity of their persons and dress
must produce the same perplexity whenever they first enter, or the
identity of appearance which the story supposes, will be destroyed.
We still, however, having a clue to the difficulty, can tell which is
which, merely from the practical contradictions which arise, as soon
as the different parties begin to speak; and we are indemnified for
the perplexity and blunders into which we are thrown by seeing
others thrown into greater and almost inextricable ones.—This play
(among other considerations) leads us not to feel much regret that
Shakespear was not what is called a classical scholar. We do not
think his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forte</span></i> would ever have lain in imitating or improving on what
others invented, so much as in inventing for himself, and perfecting
what he invented,—not perhaps by the omission of faults, but by the
addition of the highest excellencies. His own genius was strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>enough to bear him up, and he soared longest and best on unborrowed
plumes.—The only passage of a very Shakespearian cast in this
comedy is the one in which the Abbess, with admirable characteristic
artifice, makes Adriana confess her own misconduct in driving
her husband mad.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>DOUBTFUL PLAYS OF SHAKESPEAR</h3>

<p class='c011'>We shall give for the satisfaction of the reader what the celebrated
German critic, Schlegel, says on this subject, and then add a very
few remarks of our own.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘All the editors, with the exception of Capell, are unanimous in rejecting
<cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> as unworthy of Shakespear, though they always allow
it to be printed with the other pieces, as the scape-goat, as it were, of their
abusive criticism. The correct method in such an investigation is first to
examine into the external grounds, evidences, etc. and to weigh their
worth; and then to adduce the internal reasons derived from the quality
of the work. The critics of Shakespear follow a course directly the reverse
of this; they set out with a preconceived opinion against a piece, and seek,
in justification of this opinion, to render the historical grounds suspicious,
and to set them aside. <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> is to be found in the first folio
edition of Shakespear’s works, which it was known was conducted by
Heminge and Condell, for many years his friends and fellow-managers of
the same theatre. Is it possible to persuade ourselves that they would not
have known if a piece in their repertory did or did not actually belong to
Shakespear? And are we to lay to the charge of these honourable men
a designed fraud in this single case, when we know that they did not shew
themselves so very desirous of scraping everything together which went
by the name of Shakespear, but, as it appears, merely gave those plays of
which they had manuscripts in hand? Yet the following circumstance is
still stronger: George Meres, a contemporary and admirer of Shakespear,
mentions <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> in an enumeration of his works, in the year 1598.
Meres was personally acquainted with the poet, and so very intimately, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>the latter read over to him his Sonnets before they were printed. I cannot
conceive that all the critical scepticism in the world would be sufficient to
get over such a testimony.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘This tragedy, it is true, is framed according to a false idea of the
tragic, which by an accumulation of cruelties and enormities degenerates
into the horrible, and yet leaves no deep impression behind: the story of
Tereus and Philomela is heightened and overcharged under other names,
and mixed up with the repast of Atreus and Thyestes, and many other incidents.
In detail there is no want of beautiful lines, bold images, nay,
even features which betray the peculiar conception of Shakespear. Among
these we may reckon the joy of the treacherous Moor at the blackness and
ugliness of his child begot in adultery; and in the compassion of Titus
Andronicus, grown childish through grief, for a fly which had been struck
dead, and his rage afterwards when he imagines he discovers in it his black
enemy, we recognize the future poet of <cite>Lear</cite>. Are the critics afraid that
Shakespear’s fame would be injured, were it established that in his early
youth he ushered into the world a feeble and immature work? Was Rome
the less the conqueror of the world because Remus could leap over its first
walls? Let any one place himself in Shakespear’s situation at the commencement
of his career. He found only a few indifferent models, and
yet these met with the most favourable reception, because men are never
difficult to please in the novelty of an art before their taste has become
fastidious from choice and abundance. Must not this situation have had
its influence on him before he learned to make higher demands on himself,
and, by digging deeper in his own mind, discovered the richest veins of a
noble metal? It is even highly probable that he must have made several
failures before getting into the right path. Genius is in a certain sense
infallible, and has nothing to learn; but art is to be learned, and must be
acquired by practice and experience. In Shakespear’s acknowledged works
we find hardly any traces of his apprenticeship, and yet an apprenticeship
he certainly had. This every artist must have, and especially in a period
where he has not before him the example of a school already formed. I
consider it as extremely probable, that Shakespear began to write for the
theatre at a much earlier period than the one which is generally stated,
namely, not till after the year 1590. It appears that, as early as the year
1584, when only twenty years of age, he had left his paternal home and
repaired to London. Can we imagine that such an active head would
remain idle for six whole years without making any attempt to emerge by
his talents from an uncongenial situation? That in the dedication of the
poem of Venus and Adonis he calls it, ‘the first heir of his invention,’
proves nothing against the supposition. It was the first which he printed;
he might have composed it at an earlier period; perhaps, also, he did not
include theatrical labours, as they then possessed but little literary dignity.
The earlier Shakespear began to compose for the theatre, the less are we
enabled to consider the immaturity and imperfection of a work as a proof
of its spuriousness in opposition to historical evidence, if we only find in it
prominent features of his mind. Several of the works rejected as spurious,
may still have been produced in the period betwixt <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>, and
the earliest of the acknowledged pieces.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>‘At last, Steevens published seven pieces ascribed to Shakespear in two
supplementary volumes. It is to be remarked, that they all appeared in
print in Shakespear’s life-time, with his name prefixed at full length.
They are the following:—</p>

<p class='c016'>‘1. <em>Locrine.</em> The proofs of the genuineness of this piece are not altogether
unambiguous; the grounds for doubt, on the other hand, are
entitled to attention. However, this question is immediately connected
with that respecting <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>, and must be at the same time resolved
in the affirmative or negative.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘2. <cite>Pericles, Prince of Tyre.</cite> This piece was acknowledged by Dryden,
but as a youthful work of Shakespear. It is most undoubtedly his, and it
has been admitted into several of the late editions. The supposed imperfections
originate in the circumstance, that Shakespear here handled a childish
and extravagant romance of the old poet Gower, and was unwilling to
drag the subject out of its proper sphere. Hence he even introduces
Gower himself, and makes him deliver a prologue entirely in his antiquated
language and versification. This power of assuming so foreign a manner
is at least no proof of helplessness.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘3. <cite>The London Prodigal.</cite> If we are not mistaken, Lessing pronounced
this piece to be Shakespear’s, and wished to bring it on the German stage.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘4. <cite>The Puritan; or, the Widows of Watling Street.</cite> One of my literary
friends, intimately acquainted with Shakespear, was of opinion that the
poet must have wished to write a play for once in the style of Ben Jonson,
and that in this way we must account for the difference between the present
piece and his usual manner. To follow out this idea however would lead
to a very nice critical investigation.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘5. <cite>Thomas, Lord Cromwell.</cite></p>

<p class='c016'>‘6. <cite>Sir John Oldcastle—First Part.</cite></p>

<p class='c016'>‘7. <cite>A Yorkshire Tragedy.</cite></p>

<p class='c016'>‘The three last pieces are not only unquestionably Shakespear’s, but in
my opinion they deserve to be classed among his best and maturest
works.—Steevens admits at last, in some degree, that they are Shakespear’s,
as well as the others, excepting <em>Locrine</em>, but he speaks of all of them with
great contempt, as quite worthless productions. This condemnatory
sentence is not however in the slightest degree convincing, nor is it supported
by critical acumen. I should like to see how such a critic would, of
his own natural suggestion, have decided on Shakespear’s acknowledged
master-pieces, and what he would have thought of praising in them, had
the public opinion not imposed on him the duty of admiration. <cite>Thomas,
Lord Cromwell</cite>, and <em>Sir John Oldcastle</em>, are biographical dramas, and
models in this species: the first is linked, from its subject, to <cite>Henry the
Eighth</cite>, and the second to <cite>Henry the Fifth</cite>. The second part of <em>Oldcastle</em>
is wanting; I know not whether a copy of the old edition has been discovered
in England, or whether it is lost. <cite>The Yorkshire Tragedy</cite> is a
tragedy in one act, a dramatised tale of murder: the tragical effect is overpowering,
and it is extremely important to see how poetically Shakespear
could handle such a subject.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘There have been still farther ascribed to him:—1st. <cite>The Merry Devil
of Edmonton</cite>, a comedy in one act, printed in Dodsley’s old plays. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>has certainly some appearances in its favour. It contains a merry landlord,
who bears a great similarity to the one in the <cite>Merry Wives of Windsor</cite>.
However, at all events, though an ingenious, it is but a hasty sketch.
2d. <cite>The Accusation of Paris.</cite> 3d. <cite>The Birth of Merlin.</cite> 4th. <cite>Edward the
Third.</cite> 5th. <cite>The Fair Emma.</cite> 6th. <cite>Mucedorus.</cite> 7th. <cite>Arden of Feversham.</cite>
I have never seen any of these, and cannot therefore say anything
respecting them. From the passages cited, I am led to conjecture that the
subject of <cite>Mucedorus</cite> is the popular story of Valentine and Orson;
a beautiful subject which Lope de Vega has also taken for a play.
<cite>Arden of Feversham</cite> is said to be a tragedy on the story of a man, from
whom the poet was descended by the mother’s side. If the quality of the
piece is not too directly at variance with this claim, the circumstance would
afford an additional probability in its favour. For such motives were not
foreign to Shakespear: he treated Henry the Seventh, who bestowed lands
on his forefathers for services performed by them, with a visible partiality.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Whoever takes from Shakespear a play early ascribed to him, and confessedly
belonging to his time, is unquestionably bound to answer, with
some degree of probability, this question: who has then written it? Shakespear’s
competitors in the dramatic walk are pretty well known, and if
those of them who have even acquired a considerable name, a Lilly, a
Marlow, a Heywood, are still so very far below him, we can hardly imagine
that the author of a work, which rises so high beyond theirs, would have
remained unknown.’—<cite>Lectures on Dramatic Literature</cite>, vol. ii. page 252.</p>

<p class='c000'>We agree to the truth of this last observation, but not to the justice
of its application to some of the plays here mentioned. It is true
that Shakespear’s best works are very superior to those of Marlow,
or Heywood, but it is not true that the best of the doubtful plays
above enumerated are superior or even equal to the best of theirs.
<cite>The Yorkshire Tragedy</cite>, which Schlegel speaks of as an undoubted
production of our author’s, is much more in the manner of Heywood
than of Shakespear. The effect is indeed overpowering, but the
mode of producing it is by no means poetical. The praise which
Schlegel gives to <cite>Thomas, Lord Cromwell</cite>, and to <em>Sir John Oldcastle</em>,
is altogether exaggerated. They are very indifferent compositions,
which have not the slightest pretensions to rank with <cite>Henry V.</cite> or
<cite>Henry VIII.</cite> We suspect that the German critic was not very well
acquainted with the dramatic contemporaries of Shakespear, or aware
of their general merits; and that he accordingly mistakes a resemblance
in style and manner for an equal degree of excellence. Shakespear
differed from the other writers of his age not in the mode of
treating his subjects, but in the grace and power which he displayed
in them. The reason assigned by a literary friend of Schlegel’s for
supposing <cite>The Puritan; or, the Widow of Watling Street</cite>, to be
Shakespear’s, viz. that it is in the style of Ben Jonson, that is to say,
in a style just the reverse of his own, is not very satisfactory to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>plain English understanding. <cite>Locrine</cite>, and <cite>The London Prodigal</cite>, if they
were Shakespear’s at all, must have been among the sins of his youth.
<cite>Arden of Feversham</cite> contains several striking passages, but the passion
which they express is rather that of a sanguine temperament than of
a lofty imagination; and in this respect they approximate more nearly
to the style of other writers of the time than to Shakespear’s. <cite>Titus
Andronicus</cite> is certainly as unlike Shakespear’s usual style as it is
possible. It is an accumulation of vulgar physical horrors, in which
the power exercised by the poet bears no proportion to the repugnance
excited by the subject. The character of Aaron the Moor is the
only thing which shews any originality of conception; and the scene
in which he expresses his joy ‘at the blackness and ugliness of his
child begot in adultery,’ the only one worthy of Shakespear. Even
this is worthy of him only in the display of power, for it gives no
pleasure. Shakespear managed these things differently. Nor do we
think it a sufficient answer to say that this was an embryo or crude
production of the author. In its kind it is full grown, and its features
decided and overcharged. It is not like a first imperfect essay, but
shews a confirmed habit, a systematic preference of violent effect to
everything else. There are occasional detached images of great
beauty and delicacy, but these were not beyond the powers of other
writers then living. The circumstance which inclines us to reject
the external evidence in favour of this play being Shakespear’s is,
that the grammatical construction is constantly false and mixed up
with vulgar abbreviations, a fault that never occurs in any of his
genuine plays. A similar defect, and the halting measure of the
verse are the chief objections to <cite>Pericles of Tyre</cite>, if we except the
far-fetched and complicated absurdity of the story. The movement
of the thoughts and passions has something in it not unlike Shakespear,
and several of the descriptions are either the original hints of
passages which Shakespear has ingrafted on his other plays, or are
imitations of them by some contemporary poet. The most memorable
idea in it is in Marina’s speech, where she compares the world
to ‘a lasting storm, hurrying her from her friends.’</p>

<h3 class='c010'>POEMS AND SONNETS</h3>

<p class='c011'>Our idolatry of Shakespear (not to say our admiration) ceases with
his plays. In his other productions, he was a mere author, though
not a common author. It was only by representing others, that he
became himself. He could go out of himself, and express the soul
of Cleopatra; but in his own person, he appeared to be always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>waiting for the prompter’s cue. In expressing the thoughts of others,
he seemed inspired; in expressing his own, he was a mechanic.
The licence of an assumed character was necessary to restore his
genius to the privileges of nature, and to give him courage to break
through the tyranny of fashion, the trammels of custom. In his
plays, he was ‘as broad and casing as the general air’: in his poems,
on the contrary, he appears to be ‘cooped, and cabined in’ by all
the technicalities of art, by all the petty intricacies of thought and
language, which poetry had learned from the controversial jargon of
the schools, where words had been made a substitute for things.
There was, if we mistake not, something of modesty, and a painful
sense of personal propriety at the bottom of this. Shakespear’s
imagination, by identifying itself with the strongest characters in the
most trying circumstances, grappled at once with nature, and trampled
the littleness of art under his feet: the rapid changes of situation,
the wide range of the universe, gave him life and spirit, and afforded
full scope to his genius; but returned into his closet again, and having
assumed the badge of his profession, he could only labour in his
vocation, and conform himself to existing models. The thoughts,
the passions, the words which the poet’s pen, ‘glancing from heaven
to earth, from earth to heaven,’ lent to others, shook off the
fetters of pedantry and affectation; while his own thoughts and
feelings, standing by themselves, were seized upon as lawful prey,
and tortured to death according to the established rules and practice
of the day. In a word, we do not like Shakespear’s poems, because
we like his plays: the one, in all their excellencies, are just the
reverse of the other. It has been the fashion of late to cry up our
author’s poems, as equal to his plays: this is the desperate cant of
modern criticism. We would ask, was there the slightest comparison
between Shakespear, and either Chaucer or Spenser, as mere poets?
Not any.—The two poems of Venus and Adonis and of Tarquin
and Lucrece appear to us like a couple of ice-houses. They are
about as hard, as glittering, and as cold. The author seems all the
time to be thinking of his verses, and not of his subject,—not of
what his characters would feel, but of what he shall say; and as it
must happen in all such cases, he always puts into their mouths those
things which they would be the last to think of, and which it shews
the greatest ingenuity in him to find out. The whole is laboured,
up-hill work. The poet is perpetually singling out the difficulties of
the art to make an exhibition of his strength and skill in wrestling
with them. He is making perpetual trials of them as if his mastery
over them were doubted. The images, which are often striking, are
generally applied to things which they are the least like: so that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>do not blend with the poem, but seem stuck upon it, like splendid
patch-work, or remain quite distinct from it, like detached substances,
painted and varnished over. A beautiful thought is sure to be
lost in an endless commentary upon it. The speakers are like
persons who have both leisure and inclination to make riddles on their
own situation, and to twist and turn every object or incident into
acrostics and anagrams. Everything is spun out into allegory; and
a digression is always preferred to the main story. Sentiment is built
up upon plays of words; the hero or heroine feels, not from the
impulse of passion, but from the force of dialectics. There is besides
a strange attempt to substitute the language of painting for that of
poetry, to make us <em>see</em> their feelings in the faces of the persons; and
again, consistently with this, in the description of the picture in
Tarquin and Lucrece, those circumstances are chiefly insisted on,
which it would be impossible to convey except by words. The invocation
to opportunity in the Tarquin and Lucrece is full of thoughts
and images, but at the same time it is overloaded by them. The
concluding stanza expresses all our objections to this kind of
poetry:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh! idle words, servants to shallow fools;</div>
      <div class='line'>Unprofitable sounds, weak arbitrators;</div>
      <div class='line'>Busy yourselves in skill-contending schools;</div>
      <div class='line'>Debate when leisure serves with dull debaters;</div>
      <div class='line'>To trembling clients be their mediators:</div>
      <div class='line'>For me I force not argument a straw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since that my case is past all help of law.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The description of the horse in Venus and Adonis has been
particularly admired, and not without reason:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Round hoof’d, short jointed, fetlocks shag and long,</div>
      <div class='line'>Broad breast, full eyes, small head, and nostril wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>High crest, short ears, strait legs, and passing strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Look what a horse should have, he did not lack,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save a proud rider on so proud a back.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now this inventory of perfections shews great knowledge of the
horse; and is good matter-of-fact poetry. Let the reader but
compare it with a speech in the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> where
Theseus describes his hounds—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>‘And their heads are hung</div>
      <div class='line'>With ears that sweep away the morning dew’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and he will perceive at once what we mean by the difference between
Shakespear’s own poetry, and that of his plays. We prefer the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Passionate Pilgrim very much to the Lover’s Complaint. It has
been doubted whether the latter poem is Shakespear’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the Sonnets we do not well know what to say. The subject
of them seems to be somewhat equivocal; but many of them are
highly beautiful in themselves, and interesting as they relate to the
state of the personal feelings of the author. The following are some
of the most striking:—</p>

<h4 class='c022'>CONSTANCY</h4>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Let those who are in favour with their stars,</div>

      <div class='line'>Great princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>But as the marigold in the sun’s eye;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in themselves their pride lies buried,</div>
      <div class='line'>For at a frown they in their glory die.</div>
      <div class='line'>The painful warrior famous’d for fight,</div>
      <div class='line'>After a thousand victories once foil’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is from the book of honour razed quite,</div>

    <div>A LETTER TO WILLIAM GIFFORD, ESQ.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Sir,—You have an ugly trick of saying what is not true of any one
you do not like; and it will be the object of this letter to cure you
of it. You say what you please of others: it is time you were told
what you are. In doing this, give me leave to borrow the familiarity
of your style:—for the fidelity of the picture I shall be answerable.</p>

<p class='c000'>You are a little person, but a considerable cat’s-paw; and so far
worthy of notice. Your clandestine connexion with persons high in
office constantly influences your opinions, and alone gives importance
to them. You are the <em>Government Critic</em>, a character nicely differing
from that of a government spy—the invisible link, that connects
literature with the police. It is your business to keep a strict eye
over all writers who differ in opinion with his Majesty’s Ministers,
and to measure their talents and attainments by the standard of their
servility and meanness. For this office you are well qualified.
Besides being the Editor of the Quarterly Review, you are also paymaster
of the band of Gentlemen Pensioners; and when an author
comes before you in the one capacity, with whom you are not acquainted
in the other, you know how to deal with him. You have
your cue beforehand. The distinction between truth and falsehood
you make no account of: you mind only the distinction between
Whig and Tory. Accustomed to the indulgence of your mercenary
virulence and party-spite, you have lost all relish as well as capacity
for the unperverted exercises of the understanding, and make up for
the obvious want of ability by a bare-faced want of principle. The
same set of thread-bare common-places, the same second-hand assortment
of abusive nicknames, the same assumption of little magisterial
airs of superiority, are regularly repeated; and the ready convenient
lie comes in aid of the dearth of other resources, and passes off, with
impunity, in the garb of religion and loyalty. If no one finds it out,
why then there is no harm done, <em>snug’s the word</em>; or if it should be
detected, it is a good joke, shews spirit and invention in proportion to
its grossness and impudence, and it is only a pity that what was so
well meant in so good a cause, should miscarry! The end sanctifies
the means; and you keep no faith with heretics in religion or government.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>You are under the protection of the <em>Court</em>; and your zeal for
your king and country entitles you to say what you chuse of every
public writer who does not do all in his power to pamper the one
into a tyrant, and to trample the other into a herd of slaves. You
derive your weight with the great and powerful from the very circumstance
that takes away all real weight from your authority, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> that
it is avowedly, and upon every occasion, exerted for no one purpose
but to hold up to hatred and contempt whatever opposes in the slightest
degree and in the most flagrant instances of abuse their pride and
passions. You dictate your opinions to a party, because not one of
your opinions is formed upon an honest conviction of the truth or
justice of the case, but by collusion with the prejudices, caprice,
interest or vanity of your employers. The mob of well-dressed
readers who consult the Quarterly Review, know that <em>there is no offence
in it</em>. They put faith in it because they are aware that it is ‘false and
hollow, but will please the ear’; that it will tell them nothing but
what they would wish to believe. Your reasoning comes under the
head of Court-news; your taste is a standard of the prevailing <em>ton</em> in
certain circles, like Ackerman’s dresses for May. When you damn
an author, one knows that he is not a favourite at Carlton House.
When you say that an author cannot write common sense or English,
you mean that he does not believe in the doctrine of <em>divine right</em>.
Of course, the clergy and gentry will not read such an author. Your
praise or blame has nothing to do with the merits of a work, but with
the party to which the writer belongs, or is in the inverse <em>ratio</em> of its
merits. The dingy cover that wraps the pages of the Quarterly
Review does not contain a concentrated essence of taste and knowledge,
but is a receptacle for the scum and sediment of all the prejudice,
bigotry, ill-will, ignorance, and rancour, afloat in the kingdom.
This the fools and knaves who pin their faith on you know, and it is
on this account they pin their faith on you. They come to you for a
scale not of literary talent but of political subserviency. They want
you to set your mark of approbation on a writer as a thorough-paced
tool, or of reprobation as an honest man. Your fashionable readers,
Sir, are hypocrites as well as knaves and fools; and the watch-word,
the practical intelligence they want, must be conveyed to them without
implied offence to their candour and liberality, in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</span></i> and
gibberish of fraud of which you are a master. When you begin to
jabber about common sense and English, they know what to be at,
shut up the book, and wonder that any respectable publisher can be
found to let it lie on his counter, as much as if it were a Petition for
Reform. Do you suppose, Sir, that such persons as the Rev. Gerard
Valerian Wellesley and the Rev. Weeden Butler would not be glad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>to ruin what they call a Jacobin author as well as a Jacobin stationer?<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
Or that they will not thank you for persuading them that their doing
so in the former case is a proof of their taste and good sense, as well
as loyalty and religion? You know very well that if a particle of
truth or fairness were to find its way into a single number of your
publication, another Quarterly Review would be set up to-morrow for
the express purpose of depriving every author, in prose or verse, of
his reputation and livelihood, who is not a regular hack of the vilest
cabal that ever disgraced this or any other country.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is something in your nature and habits that fits you for the
situation into which your good fortune has thrown you. In the first
place, you are in no danger of exciting the jealousy of your patrons
by a mortifying display of extraordinary talents, while your sordid
devotion to their will and to your own interest at once ensures their
gratitude and contempt. To crawl and lick the dust is all they
expect of you, and all you can do. Otherwise they might fear your
power, for they could have no dependence on your fidelity: but they
take you with safety and fondness to their bosoms; for they know
that if you cease to be a tool, you cease to be anything. If you had
an exuberance of wit, the unguarded use of it might sometimes glance
at your employers; if you were sincere yourself, you might respect
the motives of others; if you had sufficient understanding, you might
attempt an argument, and fail in it. But luckily for yourself and your
admirers, you are but the dull echo, ‘the tenth transmitter’ of some
hackneyed jest: the want of all manly and candid feeling in yourself
only excites your suspicion and antipathy to it in others, as something
at which your nature recoils: your slowness to understand makes you
quick to misrepresent; and you infallibly make nonsense of what you
cannot possibly conceive. What seem your wilful blunders are often
the felicity of natural parts, and your want of penetration has all the
appearance of an affected petulance!</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, of an humble origin yourself, you recommend your performances
to persons of fashion by always abusing <em>low people</em>, with the
smartness of a lady’s waiting woman, and the independent spirit of a
travelling tutor. Raised from the lowest rank to your present despicable
eminence in the world of letters, you are indignant that any one
should attempt to rise into notice, except by the same regular trammels
and servile gradations, or should go about to separate the stamp of
merit from the badge of sycophancy. The silent listener in select
circles, and menial tool of noble families, you have become the oracle
of Church and State. The purveyor to the prejudices or passions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>a private patron succeeds, by no other title, to regulate the public
taste. You have felt the inconveniences of poverty, and look up with
base and groveling admiration to the advantages of wealth and power:
you have had to contend with the mechanical difficulties of a want of
education, and you see nothing in learning but its mechanical uses.
A self-taught man naturally becomes a pedant, and mistakes the means
of knowledge for the end, unless he is a man of genius; and you, Sir,
are not a man of genius. From having known nothing originally, you
think it a great acquisition to know anything now, no matter what or
how small it is—nay, the smaller and more insignificant it is, the more
curious you seem to think it, as it is farther removed from common
sense and human nature. The collating of points and commas is the
highest game your literary ambition can reach to, and the squabbles of
editors are to you infinitely more important than the meaning of an author.
You think more of the letter than the spirit of a passage; and in your
eagerness to show your minute superiority over those who have gone
before you, generally miss both. In comparing yourself with others,
you make a considerable mistake. You suppose the common advantages
of a liberal education to be something peculiar to yourself, and
calculate your progress beyond the rest of the world from the obscure
point at which you first set out. Yet your overweening self-complacency
is never easy but in the expression of your contempt for
others; like a conceited mechanic in a village ale-house, you would
set down every one who differs from you as an ignorant blockhead;
and very fairly infer that any one who is beneath yourself must be
nothing. You have been well called an Ultra-Crepidarian critic.
From the difficulty you yourself have in constructing a sentence of
common grammar, and your frequent failures, you instinctively presume
that no author who comes under the lash of your pen can understand
his mother-tongue: and again, you suspect every one who is not
your ‘very good friend’ of knowing nothing of the Greek or Latin,
because you are surprised to think how you came by your own knowledge
of them. There is an innate littleness and vulgarity in all you
do. In combating an opinion, you never take a broad and liberal
ground, state it fairly, allow what there is of truth or an appearance
of truth, and then assert your own judgment by exposing what is
deficient in it, and giving a more masterly view of the subject. No:
this would be committing your powers and pretensions where you dare
not trust them. You know yourself better. You deny the meaning
altogether, misquote or misapply, and then plume yourself on your
own superiority to the absurdity you have created. Your triumph
over your antagonists is the triumph of your cunning and mean-spiritedness
over some nonentity of your own making; and your wary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>self-knowledge shrinks from a comparison with any but the most puny
pretensions, as the spider retreats from the caterpillar into its web.</p>

<p class='c000'>There cannot be a greater nuisance than a dull, envious, pragmatical,
low-bred man, who is placed as you are in the situation of the Editor
of such a work as the Quarterly Review. Conscious that his reputation
stands on very slender and narrow grounds, he is naturally jealous
of that of others. He insults over unsuccessful authors; he hates
successful ones. He is angry at the faults of a work; more angry at
its excellences. If an opinion is old, he treats it with supercilious
indifference; if it is new, it provokes his rage. Everything beyond
his limited range of inquiry, appears to him a paradox and an absurdity:
and he resents every suggestion of the kind as an imposition on the
public, and an imputation on his own sagacity. He cavils at what he
does not comprehend, and misrepresents what he knows to be true.
Bound to go through the nauseous task of abusing all those who are
not like himself the abject tools of power, his irritation increases with
the number of obstacles he encounters, and the number of sacrifices he
is obliged to make of common sense and decency to his interest and
self-conceit. Every instance of prevarication he wilfully commits
makes him more in love with hypocrisy, and every indulgence of his
hired malignity makes him more disposed to repeat the insult and the
injury. His understanding becomes daily more distorted, and his
feelings more and more callous. Grown old in the service of corruption,
he drivels on to the last with prostituted impotence and shameless
effrontery; salves a meagre reputation for wit, by venting the driblets
of his spleen and impertinence on others; answers their arguments by
confuting himself; mistakes habitual obtuseness of intellect for a
particular acuteness, not to be imposed upon by shallow appearances;
unprincipled rancour for zealous loyalty; and the irritable, discontented,
vindictive, peevish effusions of bodily pain and mental imbecility
for proofs of refinement of taste and strength of understanding.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such, Sir, is the picture of which you have sat for the outline:—all
that remains is to fill up the little, mean, crooked, dirty details.
The task is to me no very pleasant one; for I can feel very little
ambition to follow you through your ordinary routine of pettifogging
objections and barefaced assertions, the only difficulty of making
which is to throw aside all regard to truth and decency, and the only
difficulty in answering them is to overcome one’s contempt for the
writer. But you are a nuisance, and should be abated.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall proceed to shew, first, your want of common honesty, in
speaking of particular persons; and, secondly, your want of common
capacity, in treating of any general question. It is this double negation
of understanding and principle that makes you all that you are.—As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>an instance of the summary manner in which you dispose of any
author who is not to your taste, you began your account of the first
work of mine you thought proper to notice (the Round Table), with
a paltry and deliberate falsehood. I need not be at much pains to
shew that your opinion on the merits of a work is not of much value,
after I have shewn that your word is not to be taken with respect
to the author. The charges which you brought against me as the
writer of that work, were chiefly these four:—1st, That I pretended
to have written a work in the manner of the Spectator; I answer,
this is a falsehood. The Advertisement to that work is written
expressly to disclaim any such idea, and to apologise for the work’s
having fallen short of the original intention of the projector (Mr.
Leigh Hunt), from its execution having devolved almost entirely
upon me, who had undertaken merely to furnish a set of essays and
criticisms, which essays and criticisms were here collected together.—2.
That I was not only a professed imitator of Addison, but a
great coiner of new words and phrases: I answer, this is also a
deliberate and contemptible falsehood. You have filled a paragraph
with a catalogue of these new words and phrases, which you attribute
to me, and single out as the particular characteristics of my style, not
any one of which I have used. This you knew.—3. You say I
write eternally about washerwomen. I answer, no such thing.
There is indeed one paper in the Round Table on this subject, and
I think a very agreeable one. I may say so, for it is not my
writing.—4. You say that ‘I praise my own chivalrous eloquence’:
and I answer, that’s a falsehood; and that you knew that I had not
applied these words to myself, because you knew that it was not I
who had used them. The last paragraph of the article in question
is true: for as if to obviate the detection of this tissue of little, lying,
loyal, catchpenny frauds, it contains a cunning, tacit acknowledgment
of them; but says, with equal candour and modesty, that it is not the
business of the writer to distinguish (in such trifling cases) between
truth and falsehood. That may be; but I cannot think that for the
editor of the Quarterly Review to want common veracity, is any disgrace
to me. It is necessary, Sir, to go into the details of this
fraudulent transaction, this Albemarle-street hoax, that the public
may know, once for all, what to think of you and me. The first
paragraph of the Review is couched in the following terms.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Whatever may have been the preponderating feelings with which
we closed these volumes, we will not refuse our acknowledgments to
Mr. Hazlitt for a few mirthful sensations,’ (that they were very few,
I can easily believe,) ‘which he has enabled us to mingle with the
rest, by the hint that his Essays were meant to be “in the manner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>the Spectator and Tatler.” The passage in which this is conveyed,
happened to be nearly the last to which we turned; and we were
about to rise from the Round Table, heavily oppressed with a recollection
of vulgar descriptions, silly paradoxes, flat truisms, misty sophistry,
broken English, ill humour, and rancorous abuse, when we were first
informed of the modest pretensions of our host. Our thoughts then
reverted with an eager impulse to the urbanity of Addison, his unassuming
tone, and clear simplicity; to the ease and softness of his
style, to the chearful benevolence of his heart. The playful gaiety
too, and the tender feelings of his coadjutor, poor Steele, came
forcibly to our memory. The effect of the ludicrous contrast thus
presented to us, it would be somewhat difficult to describe. We
think that it was akin to what we have felt from the admirable <em>nonchalance</em>
with which Liston, in the complex character of a weaver
and an ass, seems to throw away all doubt of his being the most
accomplished lover in the universe, and receives, as if they were
merely his due, the caresses of the fairy queen.’—Quarterly Review,
No. xxxiii. p. 154.</p>

<p class='c000'>The advertisement prefixed to the Round Table, in which the hint
is conveyed which afforded you ‘a few mirthful sensations,’ stood
thus.—</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The following work falls somewhat short of its title and original
intention. It was proposed by my friend Mr. Hunt, to publish a
series of papers in the Examiner, in the manner of the early periodical
essayists, the Spectator and Tatler. These papers were to be contributed
by various persons on a variety of subjects; and Mr. Hunt,
as the editor, was to take the characteristic or dramatic part of the
work upon himself. I undertook to furnish occasional essays and
criticisms; one or two other friends promised their assistance; but
the essence of the work was to be miscellaneous. The next thing
was to fix upon a title for it. After much doubtful consultation, that
of <span class='sc'>The Round Table</span> was agreed upon, as most descriptive of its
nature and design. But our plan had been no sooner arranged and
entered upon, than Buonaparte landed at Frejus, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et voila la Table
Ronde dissoute</span></i>. Our little Congress was broken up as well as the
great one. Politics called off the attention of the Editor from the
belles lettres; and the task of continuing the work fell chiefly upon
the person who was least able to give life and spirit to the original
design. A want of variety in the subjects, and mode of treating
them, is, perhaps, the least disadvantage resulting from this circumstance.
All the papers in the two volumes here offered to the public,
were written by myself and Mr. Hunt, except a letter communicated
by a friend in the sixteenth number. Out of the fifty-two numbers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>twelve are Mr. Hunt’s, with the signatures L. H. or H. T. For
all the rest I am answerable. <span class='sc'>W. Hazlitt.</span>’</p>

<p class='c000'>Such, Sir, is the passage to which you allude, with so much
hysterical satisfaction, as having let you into the secret that I fancied
myself to have produced a work ‘in the manner of the Spectator and
Tatler’; and as having relieved you from the extreme uneasiness you
had felt in reading through the ‘vulgar descriptions, silly paradoxes,
flat truisms, misty sophistry, broken English, ill humour, and rancorous
abuse,’ contained in the Round Table. If I had indeed given
myself out for a second Steele or Addison, I should have made a
very ludicrous mistake. As it is, it is you have made a wilful misstatement.
Your oppression, Sir, in rising from the Round Table,
must have been great to put you upon so desperate an expedient to
divert your chagrin, as that of affecting to suppose that I had said
just the contrary of what I did say, in order that you might affect ‘a
few mirthful sensations’ at my expence. I cannot say that I envy
you the little voluntary revulsion which your feelings underwent, at
the ludicrous comparison which you fancy me to make between myself
and Addison, on purpose to indulge the suggestions of your spleen
and prejudice. These are among the last refinements, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menus
plaisirs</span></i> of hypocrisy, of which I must remain in ignorance. I will
not require you to retract the assertion you have made, but I will take
care before I have done, that any assertion you may make with
respect to me shall not be taken as current. As to your praise of the
Tatler and Spectator, I must at all times agree to it: but as far as it
was meant as a tacit reproof to my vanity in comparing myself with
these authors, it appears to have been unnecessary. You say elsewhere,
speaking of some passage of mine—‘Addison never wrote
anything so fine!’—and again that I fancy myself a finer writer than
Addison. By your uneasy jealousy of the self-conceit of other
people, it should seem that you are in the habit of drawing comparisons,
‘secret, sweet, and precious,’ between yourself and your
‘illustrious predecessors’ not much to their advantage. As you have
here thought proper to tell me what I do not think, I will tell you
what I do think, which is, that you could not have written the
passage in question, <cite>On the Progress of Arts</cite>, because you never felt
half the enthusiasm for what is fine.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. After stating the pretensions of the work, you proceed to the
style in which it is written.—‘There is one merit which this author
possesses besides that of successful imitation—he is a very eminent
creator of words and phrases. Amongst a vast variety which have
newly started up we notice “firesider”—“kitcheny”—“to smooth
up”—“to do off”—and “to tiptoe down.” To <em>this</em> we add a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>of the author’s new-born phrases, which bear sufficient marks of a
kindred origin to entitle them to a place by <em>their</em> side. Such is the
assertion that Spenser “was dipt in poetic luxury”; the description
of “a minute coil which clicks in the baking coal”—of “a numerousness
scattering an individual gusto”—and of “curls that are ripe
with sun shine.” <em>Our readers are perhaps by this time as much
acquainted with the style of this author as they have any desire to be</em>,’ etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have nothing to do at present with the merits of the words or
phrases, which you here attribute to me, and make the test of my
general style, as if your readers truly if they persisted would find only
a constant repetition of them in my writings. I say that they are
not mine at all; that they are not characteristic of my style, that you
knew this perfectly, and also that there were reasons which prevented
me from pointing out this petty piece of chicanery; and farther, I
say that I am so far from being ‘a very eminent creator of words
and phrases,’ that I do not believe you can refer to an instance in
anything I have written in which there is a single new word or
phrase. In fact, I am as tenacious on this score of never employing
any new words to express my ideas, as you, Sir, are of never
expressing any ideas that are not perfectly thread-bare and commonplace.
My style is as old as your matter. This is the fault you at
other times find with it, mistaking the common idiom of the language
for ‘broken English.’</p>

<p class='c000'>3. You say that ‘I write eternally about washerwomen’; and
pray, if I did, what is that to you, Sir? There is a littleness in your
objections which makes even the answers to them ridiculous, and
which would make it impossible to notice them, were you not the
Government-Critic. You say yourself indeed afterwards that ‘It is
he’ (Mr. Hunt) ‘who devotes <em>ten or twelve pages</em> to a dissertation
on washerwomen.’ Good: what you say on this subject is a fair
specimen of your mind and manners. The playing at fast-and-loose
with the matter-of-fact may be passed over as a matter of course in
your hypercritical lucubrations. There is but one half paper on this
interdicted subject in the Round Table:—you have filled one page out
of five of the article in the Review with a ridicule of this paper on
account of the vulgarity of the subject, which offends you exceedingly;
you recur to it twice afterwards <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</span></i>, and end your
performance (somewhat in the style of a quack-doctor aping his own
merry-andrew) with ‘two or three conclusive digs in the side at it.’
There is something in the subject that makes a strong impression
on your mind. You seem ‘to hate it with a perfect hatred.’<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Now I would ask where is the harm of this dissertation on
washerwomen inserted in the Round Table, any more than those
of Dutch and Flemish kitchen-pieces, the glossy brilliancy and
high finishing of which must have become familiar to your eye
in the collections of Earl Grosvenor, Lord Mulgrave, and the
Marquis of Stafford? What has Mr. Hunt done in this never-to-be
forgiven paper to betray the lowness of his breeding or sentiments,
or to shew that he who wrote it is ‘the droll or merry fellow of the
piece,’ and that I who <em>did not write it</em> am ‘a sour Jacobin, who hate
everything but washerwomen’? Would Addison or Steele, ‘poor
Steele’ as you call him, have brought this as a capital charge against
their ‘imitators’? Did they instinctively direct their speculations or
limit their views of human life to ‘remarks on gentlemen and gentlewomen’?
They often enough treated of low people and familiar life
without any consciousness of degradation. ‘Their gorge did not
rise’ at the humble worth or homely enjoyments of their fellow-creatures,
like your’s. A coronet or a mitre were not the only things
that caught their jaundiced eye, or soothed their rising gall. They
who are always talking of high and low people are generally of a
vulgar origin themselves, and of an inherent meanness of disposition
which nothing can overcome. Besides, there is a want of good
faith, as well as of good taste, in your affected fastidiousness on this
point. ‘You assume a vice, though you have it not,’ or not to the
degree, which your petulance and servility would have us suppose. A
short time before you wrote this uncalled-for tirade against Mr. Hunt
as an exclusive patroniser of that class of females, ycleped ‘washerwomen,’
he had quoted with praise in the Examiner, and as a mark
of tender and humane feelings in the author, in spite of appearances
to the contrary, the following epitaph from the Gentleman’s Magazine.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>‘<span class='sc'>Epitaph by William Gifford, Esq.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>‘We are no friends, publicly speaking, to the author of the following
epitaph. We differ much with his politics, and with the cast of his
satire; and do not think him, properly speaking, a poet, as many do.
But we always admired the spirit that looked forth from his account
of his own life, and the touching copy of verses on a departed friend,
that are to be found in the notes to one of his satires; and there are
feelings and circumstances in this world, before which politics and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>satire, and poetry, are of little importance’—(<em>How little knew’st thou
of Calista!</em>)—‘feelings, that triumph over infirmity and distaste of
every sort, and only render us anxious, in our respect for them, to be
thought capable of appreciating them ourselves. The world, with all
its hubbub, slides away from before one on such occasions; and we only
see humanity in all its better weakness, and let us add, in all its beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The author will think what he pleases of this effusion of ours.
It is an interval in the battle, during which we only wish to show
ourselves fellow-men with him. Afterwards, he may resume his
hostilities, if he has any, and we will draw our swords as before.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Mr. Urban,—I am one of those who love to contemplate the
“frail memorials” of the dead, and do not, therefore, count the
solitary hours, occasionally spent in a church-yard, among the most
melancholy ones of my life. But in London, this is a gratification
rarely to be found; for, either through caution, or some less worthy
motive, the cemeteries are closed against the stranger. I have been
in the practice of passing by the chapel in South Audley Street,
Grosvenor Square, almost every day, for several weeks, yet never saw
the door of the burying-ground open till yesterday. I did not neglect
the opportunity thus offered, but walked in. I found it far more
spacious and airy than I expected; but I met with nothing very
novel or interesting till I came to a low tomb, plain but neat, where
I was both pleased and surprised by the following inscription, which, I
believe, has never yet appeared in print, and which seems not unworthy
of your miscellany.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It seems then, you can extract the pathetic though not the
humorous, out of persons who are not ‘gentlemen or gentlewomen.’
It was the amiable weakness thus noticed, that made you take such
pains to do away the suspicion of a particular partiality for low
people. You could not afford ‘the frail memorial’ of your private
virtues to get beyond the inscription on a tomb-stone, or the poet’s
corner of the Gentleman’s Magazine. The natural sympathies of the
undoubted translator of Juvenal might be a prejudice to the official
character of the anonymous editor of the Quarterly Review. You
were determined to hear no more of this epitaph, and ‘other such
dulcet diseases’<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a> of yours.—You perhaps recollect, Sir, that the
columns of the Examiner newspaper, which gave you such a premature
or posthumous credit for some ‘compunctious visitings of nature,’ also
contained the first specimen of the Story of Rimini. You seem to
have said on that occasion with Iago, ‘You are well tuned now,—but
I’ll set down the pegs that make this music, <em>as honest as I am</em>.’—That
Mr. Hunt should have supposed it possible for a moment,
that a government automaton was accessible to anything like a liberal
concession, is one of those deplorable mistakes which constantly put
men who are ‘made of penetrable stuff,’ at the mercy of those who
are not. The amiable and elegant author of Rimini thought he was
appealing to something human in your breast, in the recollection of
your ‘Dear Ann Davies’; he touched the springs, and found them
‘stuffed with paltry blurred sheets’ of the Quarterly Review, with
notes from Mr. Murray, and directions how to proceed with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>author, from the Admiralty Scribe. You retorted his sympathy with
‘one whom earth could never pay,’ by laughing to scorn his honest
laborious ‘tub-tumbling viragos,’ whose red elbows and coarse fists
prevented so inelegant a contrast to the pining and sickly form whose
loss you deplore. Is there anything in your nature and disposition
that draws to it only the infirm in body and oppressed in mind; or
that, while it clings to power for support, seeks consolation in the
daily soothing spectacle of physical malady or morbid sensibility?
The air you breathe seems to infect; and your friendship to be a
canker-worm that blights its objects with unwholesome and premature
decay. You are enamoured of suffering, and are at peace only with
the dead.—Even if you had been accessible to remorse as a political
critic, Mr. Hunt had committed himself with you (past forgiveness)
in your character of a pretender to poetry about town. The following
lines in his Feast of the Poets, must have occasioned you ‘a few
mirthful sensations,’ which you have not yet acknowledged, except
by deeds.—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A hem was then heard, consequential and snapping,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a sour little gentleman walked with a rap in.</div>
      <div class='line'>He bow’d, look’d about him, seem’d cold, and sat down,</div>
      <div class='line'>And said,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a> “I’m surpris’d that you’ll visit this town:—</div>

      <div class='line'>“Yourself and your friends!” cried the God in high glee;</div>
      <div class='line'>“And pray my frank visitor, who may you be?”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Who be?” cried the other; “why really—this tone—</div>

      <div class='line'>“Oh—now I remember,” said Phœbus;—“ah true—</div>

      <div class='line'>In the self-taught example, that conquer’d neglect.</div>
      <div class='line'>But not to insist on the recommendations</div>
      <div class='line'>Of modesty, wit, and a small stock of patience,</div>
      <div class='line'>My visit just now is to poets alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not to small critics, however well known.”</div>
      <div class='line'>So saying, he rang, to leave nothing in doubt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the sour little gentleman bless’d himself out.’</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span><em>Thus painters write their names at Co.</em> For this passage and the
temperate and judicious note which accompanies it, it is no wonder
that you put the author—of Rimini, in Newgate, without the Sheriff’s
warrant. In order to give as favourable an impression of that poem
as you could, you began your account of it by saying that it had been
composed in Newgate, though you knew that it had not; but you
also knew that the name of Newgate would sound more grateful to
certain ears, to pour flattering poison into which is the height of your
abject ambition. In this courtly inuendo which ushered in your
wretched verbal criticism (it is the more disgusting to see such gross
and impudent prevarication combined with such petty captiousness)
you were guided not by a regard to truth, but to your own ends; and
yet you say somewhere, very oracularly, out of contradiction to me, that
‘not to prefer the true to the agreeable, where they are inconsistent,
is folly.’ You have mistaken the word: it is not folly, but knavery.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>4. You say you have no objection to my ‘praising my own
chivalrous eloquence’; and I say that the insinuation is impertinent
and untrue. The paper in which that phrase occurs is written by
Mr. Hunt, as you know, and is an answer to some observations of
mine on the poetical temperament in a preceding number <cite>On the
Causes of Methodism</cite>. Mr. Hunt’s having taken upon him ‘to praise
my chivalrous eloquence,’ without consulting you, appeared no doubt
a great piece of presumption; and you punished me by magnifying
this indiscretion into the enormity of my having praised myself. I
might as well say that Mr. Canning had made a fulsome eulogy on
his own private virtues and public principles in your dedication of the
edition of Ben Jonson to him.—You say indeed in the last paragraph
of your criticism that ‘you understand some of the papers to be by
Mr. Hunt; that it is he who is the droll or merry fellow of the
piece; who has shocked you by writing eternally about washerwomen,
etc. but that you cannot stay to distinguish between us, and
that we must divide our respective share of merit between ourselves.’
The share of merit in that work may indeed be so small that it is of
little consequence who has the reversion of any part of it, but I will
take care that a cat’s-paw shall not be put on the pannel of my
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantum meruit</span></i>, nor take measure of my capacity with a mechanic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>rule, marked by ignorance and servility, nor turn the scale of public
opinion by throwing in false weights as he pleases, nor make both of
us ridiculous, by attributing to each the peculiarities of the other,
with whatever exaggerated interpretation he chuses to put upon them.
By this transposition of persons, which is not a matter of indifference
as you pretend, you gain this advantage which you have no right to
gain. You can at any time apply to me or Mr. Hunt the obnoxious
points in your account of either, and improve upon them, as it suits
your purpose. By combining the extremes of individual character,
you make a very strange and wilful compound of your own. It is
the same person, and yet it is not one person but two persons,
according to the critical creed you would establish, who is a merry
fellow, and a sour Jacobin; who is all gaiety and all gloom; a
person who rails at poets, and yet is himself a poet; a hater of cats,
and of cat’s-paws;<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a> a reviler of Mr. Pitt, and a panegyrist upon
washerwomen. If, Sir, your friend, Mr. Hoppner, of whom, as
you tell us<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a> you discreetly said nothing, while he was struggling
with obscurity, lest it should be imputed to the partiality of
friendship, but whom you praised and dedicated to, as soon as
he became popular, to shew your disinterestedness and deference to
public opinion, if even this artist, whom you celebrate as a painter of
flattering likenesses, had undertaken to unite in one piece the most
striking features and characteristic expression of his and your common
friends, had improved your lurking archness of look into Mr.
Murray’s gentle, downcast obliquity of vision; had joined Mr.
Canning’s drooping nose to Mr. Croker’s aspiring chin, the clear
complexion (the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">splendida bilis</span></i>) of the one, to the candid self-complacent
aspect of the other; had forced into the same preposterous
medley, the invincible <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hauteur</span></i> and satanic pride of Mr. Pitt’s
physiognomy, with the dormant meaning and admirable nonchalance
of Lord Castlereagh’s features, the manly sleekness of Charles Long,
and the monumental outline of John Kemble—what mortal would
have owned the likeness!—I too, Sir, must claim the privilege of
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">principium individuationis</span></i>, for myself as well as my neighbours; I
will sit for no man’s picture but my own, and not to you for that;
I am not desirous to play so many parts as Bottom, and as to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>ass’s head which you would put upon my shoulders, it will do for
you to wear the next time you shew yourself in Mr. Murray’s shop,
or for your friend Mr. Southey to take with him, whenever he
appears at Court.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the difference of political sentiment between the writer of
the Round Table and the writer of the article in the Review, which
forms the heavy burthen of your flippant censure, I cannot consider
that as an accusation. You have many other objections to make:
such as that, because Mr. Addison wrote some very pleasing papers
on the Pleasures of the Imagination, I am not willing to fall short of
‘my illustrious predecessor’; and ‘accordingly,’ you say, ‘we hear
much of poetry and of painting, and of music and of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i>.’ Is this
the only reason you can conceive why any one should take an interest
in such things; or did you write your Baviad and Mæviad that you
might not fall short of Pope, your translation of Juvenal that you
might surpass Dryden, or did you turn commentator on the poets,
that you might be on a par with ‘your illustrious predecessors’—‘from
slashing Bentley down to piddling Theobalds’? Of Hogarth
you make me say, quoting from your favourite treatise on washerwomen,
that ‘he is too apt to perk morals and sentiments in your
face.’ You cannot comprehend my definition of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i>, which you do
not ascribe to any defect in yourself. My account of Titian and
Vandyke’s colouring, appears to you very odd, because it is like
the things described, and you have no idea of the things described.
If I had described the style of these two painters in terms applicable
to them both, and to all other painters, you would have thought the
precision of the style equal to the justness of the sentiment. A
distinction without a difference satisfies you, for you can understand
or repeat a common-place. It is the pointing out the real differences
of things that offends you, for you have no idea of what is meant;
and a writer who gets at all below the surface of a question,
necessarily gets beyond your depth, and you can hardly contain
your wonder at his presumption and shallowness. You quote half
a dozen detached sentences of mine, as ‘convincing instances of
affectation and paradox,’ (such as, <em>The definition of a true patriot is a
good hater—He who speaks two languages has no country</em>, etc.) and
which taken from the context to which they belong, and of which
they are brought as extreme illustrations, may be so, but which you
cannot answer in the connection in which they stand, and which you
detach from the general speculation with which you dare not cope, to
bring them more into the focus of your microscopic vision, and that
you may deal with them more at ease and in safety on your old
ground of literal and verbal quibbling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>You do not like the subjects of my Essays in general. You
complain in particular of ‘my eager vituperation of good nature and
good-natured people’; and yet with this you have, as I should take
it, nought to do: you object to my sweeping abuse of poets, as (with
the exception of Milton) dishonest men,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a> with which you have as
little to do; you are no poet, and of course, honest! You do not
like my abuse of the Scotch at which the Irish were delighted, nor
my abuse of the Irish at which the Scotch were not displeased,
nor my abuse of the English, which I can understand; but I wonder
you should not like my abuse of the French. You say indeed that
‘no abuse which is directed against whole classes of men is of much
importance,’ and yet you and your Anti-Jacobin friends have been
living upon this sort of abuse for the last twenty years. You add
with characteristic ‘no meaning’—‘<em>If undeserved</em>, it is utterly impotent
and may be well utterly despised.’ The last part of the
proposition may be true, but abuse is not without effect, because
undeserved, nor is a thing utterly impotent because it is thoroughly
despicable. You, Sir, have power which is considerable, in proportion
as it is despicable!</p>

<p class='c000'>I confess, Sir, the Round Table did not take; ‘it was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caveare</span></i> to
the multitude,’ but the reason, I think, was not that the abuse in it
was undeserved, but that I have there spoken the truth of too many
persons and things. In writing it, I preferred the true to the
agreeable, which I find to be an unpardonable fault. Yet I am
not aware of any sentiment in the work which ought to give offence
to an honest and inquiring mind, for I think there is none that does
not evidently proceed from a conviction of its truth and a bias to
what is right. My object in writing it was to set down such
observations as had occurred to me from time to time on different
subjects, and as appeared to be any ways worth preserving. I
wished to make a sort of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Veritatis</span></i>, a set of studies from
human life. As my object was not to flatter, neither was it to
offend or contradict others, but to state my own feelings or opinions
such as they really were, but more particularly of course when this
had not been done before, and where I thought I could throw any
new light upon a subject. In doing so, I endeavoured to fix my
attention only on the thing I was writing about, and which had
struck me in some particular manner, which I wished to point out
to others, with the best reasons or explanations I could give. I was
not the slave of prejudices; nor do I think I was the dupe of
my own vanity. To repeat what has been said a thousand times is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>common-place: to contradict it because it has been so said, is not
originality. A truth is, however, not the worse but the better for
being new. I did not try to think with the multitude nor to differ
with them, but to think for myself; and the having done this with
some boldness and some effect is the height of my offending. I
wrote to the public with the same sincerity and want of disguise as
if I had been making a register of my private thoughts; and
this has been construed by some into a breach of decorum. The
affectation I have been accused of was merely my sometimes stating
a thing in an extreme point of view for fear of not being understood;
and my love of paradox may, I think, be accounted for from the
necessity of counteracting the obstinacy of prejudice. If I have been
led to carry a remark too far, it was because others would not allow
it to have any force at all. My object was to shew the latent operation
of some unsuspected principle, and I therefore took only some
one view of that particular subject. I was chiefly anxious that the
germ of thought should be true and original; that I should put others
in possession of what I meant, and then left it to find its level in the
operation of common sense, and to have its excesses corrected by
other causes. The principle will be found true, even where the
application is extravagant or partial. I have not been wedded to my
particular speculations with the spirit of a partisan. I wrote for
instance an Essay on Pedantry, to qualify the extreme contempt into
which it has fallen, and to shew the necessary advantages of an
absorption of the whole mind in some favourite study, and I wrote
an Essay on the Ignorance of the Learned to lessen the undue
admiration of Learning, and to shew that it is not everything. I
gained very few converts to either of these opinions. You reproach
me with the cynical turn of many of my Essays, which are in fact
prose-satires; but when you say I hate every thing but washerwomen,
you forget what you had before said that I was a great
imitator of Addison, and wrote much about ‘poetry and painting,
and music and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i>.’ You make no mention of my character of
Rousseau, or of the paper on Actors and Acting. You also forget
my praise of John Buncle! As to my style, I thought little about
it. I only used the word which seemed to me to signify the idea I
wanted to convey, and I did not rest till I had got it. In seeking
for truth, I sometimes found beauty. As to the facility of which
you, Sir, and others accuse me, it has not been acquired at once nor
without pains. I was eight years in writing eight pages, under
circumstances of inconceivable and ridiculous discouragement. As
to my figurative and gaudy phraseology, you reproach me with it
because you never heard of what I had written in my first dry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>manner. I afterwards found a popular mode of writing necessary to
convey subtle and difficult trains of reasoning, and something more
than your meagre vapid style, to force attention to original observations,
which did not restrict themselves to making a parade of the
discovery of a worm-eaten date, or the repetition of an obsolete prejudice.
You say that it is impossible to remember what I write after
reading it:—One remembers to have read what you write—<em>before</em>!
In that you have the advantage of me, to be sure. You in vain
endeavour to account for the popularity of some of my writings,
from the trick of arranging words in a variety of forms without any
correspondent ideas, like the newly-invented optical toy. You have
not hit upon the secret, nor will you be able to avail yourself of it
when I tell you. It is the old story—<em>that I think what I please,
and say what I think</em>. This accounts, Sir, for the difference between
you and me in so many respects. I think only of the argument I
am defending; you are only thinking whether you write grammar.
My opinions are founded on reasons which I try to give; yours are
governed by motives which you keep to yourself. It has been my
business all my life to get at the truth as well as I could, merely to
satisfy my own mind: it has been yours to suppress the evidence of
your senses and the dictates of your understanding, if you ever found
them at variance with your convenience or the caprices of others. I
do not suppose you ever in your life took an interest in any abstract
question for its own sake, or have a conception of the possibility of
any one else doing so. If you had, you would hardly insist on my
changing characters with you. Yet you make this the condition of
my receiving any favour or lenity at your hands. It is no matter,
Sir: I will try to do without it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears by your own account, that all the other offences of the
Round Table would hardly have roused your resentment, had it not
been that I have spoken of Mr. Pitt and Mr. Burke, not in the
hackneyed terms of a treasury underling. It was this that filled up
the measure of my iniquity, and the storm burst on my devoted head.
After quoting one or two half sentences from the character of Mr.
Pitt,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a> in which I ascribe the influence of his oratory almost entirely
to a felicitous and imposing arrangement of words, and the whole of a
short note on Mr. Burke’s political apostacy, which I had fancifully
ascribed to his jealousy of Rousseau, you add with great sincerity:—‘We
are far from intending to write a single word in answer to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>loathsome trash’—(it would have been well if you had made and
kept the same resolution in other cases,) ‘but we confess that these
passages chiefly excited us to take the trouble of noticing the work.
The author might have described washerwomen for ever; complimented
himself unceasingly on his own “chivalrous eloquence”;
prosed interminably about Chaucer; written, if possible, in a more
affected, silly, confused, ungrammatical style, and believed, as he
now believes, that he was surpassing Addison, we should not have
meddled with him; but if the creature, in his endeavours to crawl
into the light, must take his way over the tombs of illustrious men,
disfiguring the records of their greatness with the slime and filth
which marks his track, it is right to point him out that he may be
flung back to the situation in which nature designed that he should
grovel’ p. 159. And this, Sir, from you who wrote or procured
to be inserted in the Quarterly Review, that nefarious attack on the
character of Mr. Fox, which was distinguished and is still remembered
among the slime and filth which has marked its track into day,
over the characters and feelings of the living and the dead. If I,
Sir, had written that ‘foul and vulgar invective’ against an individual
whom you did not choose to let ‘rest in his grave,’ if I had been
‘such a thing’ as the writer of that article, I might, (as you say,)
have described washerwomen for ever, and have fancied myself a
better writer than ‘the courtly Addison,’ and you, Sir, would have
encouraged me in the delusion, for I should have been a court-tool,
<em>your</em> tool. But you state the thing clearly and unanswerably. I
was not a court-tool, your tool, and therefore I was to be made your
victim. There is a difference of political opinion between you and
me; therefore you undertake not only to condemn that opinion, but
to proscribe the writer. Do you do this on your own authority, or
on Mr. Croker’s, or on whose? As I did not consider it as sacrilege
to criticise the style and the opinions of the two great men who have
contributed to make this country what it is, a fief held by a junto, of
which men like you are the organs, in trust and for the benefit of the
common cause of despotism throughout Europe, I, and every other
writer like me, professing or maintaining anything like independence
of spirit or consistency of opinion, is ‘to be flung back into his
original obscurity, and stifled in the filth and slime’ of the Quarterly
Review, or its drain, Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine. You began
the experiment upon the Round Table; you have tried it twice since,
and for the last time.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any doubts could ever have been entertained on the subject of
your motives and views, you have taken care to remove them. Thus
you conclude your account of the characters of Shakespear’s plays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>with saying, that you should not have condescended to notice the
senseless and wicked sophistry of the work at all, but that ‘you conceived
it might not be unprofitable to shew how small a portion of
talent and literature is necessary to carry on the trade of sedition.’
I should think it requires as much talent and literature to carry on
my trade as yours. This acknowledgment of yours is ‘remarkable
for its truth and <em>naiveté</em>.’ It is a pledge from your own mouth of
your impartiality and candour. With this object in view, ‘you have
selected a few specimens of my ethics and criticism,’ (they are very
few, and of course you would select no others,) just sufficient, (with
your garbling and additions,) to prove ‘that my knowledge of Shakespear
and the English language is exactly on a par with the purity of
my morals, and the depth of my understanding.’ But did it not
occur to you in making this officious declaration, or would it not
occur to any one else in reading it, that this undertaking of yours
might be no less ‘profitable’ and acceptable, even supposing the
portion of talent displayed by the author not to be small but great?
Would it not be more necessary in this case to do away the scandal
that there was any talent or literature on the side of ‘sedition’?
The greater the shock given to the complacency of servility and
corruption, by an opinion getting abroad that there was any knowledge
of Shakespear or the English language except on the minister’s
side of the question, would it not be the more absolutely incumbent
on you as the head of the literary police, to arrest such an opinion in
the outset, to crush it before it gathered strength, and to produce the
article in question as your warrant? Why, what a disgrace to literature
and to loyalty, if owing to the neglect and supineness of the
editor of the Quarterly Review, a work written without an atom of
cant or hypocrisy, and of course with a very small portion of talent
and literature, should, in the space of three months get into a second
edition, and be fast advancing to a third, be noticed in the Edinburgh
Review, and be talked of by persons who never looked into the
Examiner; and how necessary without loss of time, to counteract the
mischievous inference from all this, restore the taste of the public to
its legitimate tone, and satisfy the courteous reader, who ‘was well
affected to the constitution in church and state as now established,’
that in future he must look for a knowledge of Shakespear only in
the editor of Ben Jonson, of the English language in the private tutor
of Lord Grosvenor, for purity of morals in the translator of Juvenal,
and for depth of understanding in the notes to the Baviad and
Mæviad! Your employers, Mr. Gifford, do not pay their hirelings
for nothing—for condescending to notice weak and wicked sophistry;
for pointing out to contempt what excites no admiration; for cautiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>selecting a few specimens of bad taste and bad grammar, where
nothing else is to be found. They want your invincible pertness,
your mercenary malice, your impenetrable dulness, your barefaced
impudence, your pragmatical self-sufficiency, your hypocritical zeal,
your pious frauds to stand in the gap of their prejudices and pretensions,
to fly-blow and taint public opinion, to defeat independent
efforts, to apply not the sting of the scorpion but the touch of the
torpedo to youthful hopes, to crawl and leave the slimy track of
sophistry and lies over every work that does not ‘dedicate its sweet
leaves’ to some luminary of the Treasury Bench, or is not fostered
in the hot-bed of corruption. This is your office; ‘this is what is
looked for at your hands, and this you do not baulk’—to sacrifice
what little honesty, and prostitute what little intellect you possess to
any dirty job you are commissioned to execute. ‘They keep you
as an ape does an apple, in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed to
be last swallowed.’ You are, by appointment, literary toad-eater
to greatness, and taster to the court. You have a natural aversion
to whatever differs from your own pretensions, and an acquired one
for what gives offence to your superiors. Your vanity panders to
your interest, and your malice truckles only to your love of power.
If your instinctive or premeditated abuse of your enviable trust were
found wanting in a single instance; if you were to make a single
slip in getting up your select Committee of Inquiry and Green Bag
Report of the State of Letters, your occupation would be gone.
You would never after obtain a squeeze of the hand from a great
man, or a smile from a punk of quality. The great and powerful
(whom you call the wise and good) do not like to have the privacy
of their self-love startled by the obtrusive and unmanageable claims
of literature and philosophy, except through the intervention of
persons like you, whom, if they have common penetration, they soon
find out to be without any superiority of intellect; or, if they do not,
whom they can despise for their meanness of soul. You ‘have the
office opposite to St. Peter.’ You ‘keep a corner in the public
mind, for foul prejudice and corrupt power to knot and gender in’;
you volunteer your services to people of quality to ease scruples of
mind and qualms of conscience; you ‘lay the flattering unction’ of
venal prose and laurelled verse to their souls. You persuade them
that there is neither purity of morals, nor depth of understanding,
except in themselves and their hangers-on; and would prevent the
unhallowed names of liberty and humanity from being ever whispered
in ears polite! You, Sir, do you not do all this? I cry you mercy
then: I took you for the Editor of the Quarterly Review!</p>

<p class='c000'>In general, you wisely avoid committing yourself upon any question,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>farther than to hint a difference of opinion, and to assume an air of
self-importance upon it. Thus you say, after quoting some remarks
of mine, not very respectful to Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> ‘We need not answer
this gabble,’ as if you were offended at its absurdity, not at its truth;
and were yourself ready to assert (were it worth while) that
Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> was an estimable character, or that he had not his
minions and creatures about him in his life-time, who were proud
to hail him as the best of kings. If so, you have the authority of
Mr. Burke against you, who indulges himself in a very Jacobinical
strain of invective against this bloated pattern of royalty, and brute-image
of the Divinity. Do you mean to say, that the circumstances
of external pomp and unbridled power, which I have pointed out in
‘the gabble you will not answer’ as determining the character of
kings, do not make them what for the most part they are, feared in
their life-time and scorned by after-ages? If so, you must think
Quevedo a libeller and incendiary, who makes his guide to the
infernal regions, on being asked ‘if there were no more kings,’
answer emphatically—‘Here are all that ever lived!’ You say
that ‘the mention of a court or of a king always throws me into a
fit of raving.’ Do you then really admire those plague spots of
history, and scourges of human nature, Richard <span class='fss'>II.</span>, Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span>,
King John, and Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span>? Do you with Mr. Coleridge, in his
late Lectures, contend that not to fall down in prostration of soul
before the abstract majesty of kings as it is seen in the diminished
perspective of centuries, argues an inherent littleness of mind? Or
do you extend the moral of your maxim—‘Speak not of the imputed
weaknesses of the Great’—beyond the living to the dead, thus
passing an attainder on history, and proving ‘truth to be a liar’ from
the beginning? ‘Speak out, Grildrig!’</p>

<p class='c000'>You do well to confine yourself to the hypocrite; for you have
too little talent for the sophist. Yet in two instances you have
attempted an answer to an opinion I had expressed; and in both
you have shewn how little you can understand the commonest question.
The first is as follows:—‘In his remarks upon Coriolanus,
which contain the concentrated venom of his malignity, he has
libelled our great poet as a friend of arbitrary power, in order that
he may introduce an invective against human nature. “Shakspeare
himself seems to have had a leaning to the arbitrary side of the
question, perhaps from some feeling of contempt for his own origin;
and to have spared no occasion of baiting the rabble.”’</p>

<p class='c000'>How do you prove that he did not? By shewing with a little
delicate insinuation how he would have done just what I say he did.—‘Shall
we not be dishonouring the gentle Shakspeare by answering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>such calumny, when every page of his works supplies its refutation?’<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a>—‘Who
has painted with more cordial feelings the tranquil innocence
of humble life?’ [True.] ‘Who has furnished more instructive
lessons to the great upon “the insolence of office”—“the oppressor’s
wrong”—or the abuses of brief authority’—[which you would
hallow through all time]—‘or who has more severely stigmatised
those “who crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may
follow fawning?”’ [Granted, none better.] ‘It is true he was not
actuated by an envious hatred of greatness’—[so that to stigmatise
servility and corruption does not always proceed from envy and a
love of mischief]—‘he was not at all likely, had he lived in our
time, to be an orator in Spa-fields or the editor of a seditious Sunday
newspaper’—[To have delivered Mr. Coleridge’s <cite>Conciones ad
Populum</cite>, or to have written Mr. Southey’s Wat Tyler]—‘he knew
what discord would follow if degree were taken away’—[As it did
in France from the taking away the degree between the tyrant and
the slave, and those little convenient steps and props of it, the Bastile,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lettres de Cachet</span>, and Louis <span class='fss'>XV.</span>‘s <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Palais aux cerfs</span></cite>]—‘And <em>therefore</em>,
with the wise and good of every age, he pointed out the injuries that
must arise to society from a turbulent rabble instigated to mischief by
men not much more enlightened, and infinitely more worthless than
themselves.’</p>

<p class='c000'>So that it would appear by your own account that Shakspeare had
a discreet leaning to the arbitrary side of the question, and, had he
lived in our time, would probably have been a writer in the Courier,
or a contributor to the Quarterly Review! It is difficult to know
which to admire most in this, the weakness or the cunning. I have
said that Shakspeare has described both sides of the question, and
you ask me very wisely, ‘Did he confine himself to one?’ No, I
say that he did not: but I suspect that he had a leaning to one side,
and has given it more quarter than it deserved. My words are:
‘<cite>Coriolanus</cite> is a storehouse of political common-places. The arguments
for and against aristocracy and democracy, on the privileges
of the few and the claims of the many, on liberty and slavery, power
and the abuse of it, peace and war, are here very ably handled, with
the spirit of a poet and the acuteness of a philosopher. Shakspeare
himself seems to have had a leaning to the arbitrary side of the
question, perhaps from some feeling of contempt for his own origin,
and to have spared no occasion of baiting the rabble. <em>What he says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>of them is very true: what he says of their betters is also very true,
though he dwells less upon it.</em>’</p>

<p class='c000'>I then proceed to account for this by shewing how it is that ‘the
cause of the people is but little calculated for a subject for poetry;
or that the language of poetry naturally falls in with the language of
power.’ I affirm, Sir, that poetry, that the imagination, generally
speaking, delights in power, in strong excitement, as well as in truth,
in good, in right, whereas, pure reason and the moral sense approve
only of the true and good. I proceed to shew that this general love
or tendency to immediate excitement or theatrical effect, no matter
how produced, gives a bias to the imagination often inconsistent with
the greatest good, that in poetry it triumphs over principle, and bribes
the passions to make a sacrifice of common humanity. You say that
it does not, that there is no such original sin in poetry, that it makes
no such sacrifice or unworthy compromise between poetical effect
and the still small voice of reason. And how do you prove that
there is no such principle giving a bias to the imagination, and a false
colouring to poetry? Why by asking in reply to the instances where
this principle operates, and where no other can, with much modesty
and simplicity—‘But are these the only topics that afford delight in
poetry, etc.’ No; but these objects do afford delight in poetry, and
they afford it in proportion to their strong and often tragical effect,
and not in proportion to the good produced, or their desirableness in
a moral point of view. ‘Do we read with more pleasure of the
ravages of a beast of prey, than of the shepherd’s pipe upon the
mountain?’ No; but we do read with pleasure of the ravages of
a beast of prey, and we do so on the principle I have stated, namely,
from the sense of power abstracted from the sense of good; and it
is the same principle that makes us read with admiration and reconciles
us in fact to the triumphant progress of the conquerors and mighty
hunters of mankind, who come to stop the shepherd’s pipe upon the
mountains, and sweep away his listening flock. Do you mean to
deny that there is anything imposing to the imagination in power,
in grandeur, in outward shew, in the accumulation of individual
wealth and luxury, at the expense of equal justice and the common
weal? Do you deny that there is anything in ‘the pride, pomp,
and circumstance of glorious war, that makes ambition virtue,’ in the
eyes of admiring multitudes? Is this a new theory of the Pleasures
of the Imagination, which says that the pleasures of the imagination
do not take rise solely in the calculations of the understanding? Is
it a paradox of my making, that ‘one murder makes a villain, millions
a hero!’ Or is it not true that here, as in other cases, the enormity
of the evil overpowers and makes a convert of the imagination by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>its very magnitude? You contradict my reasoning, because you
know nothing of the question, and you think that no one has a right
to understand what you do not. My offence against purity in the
passage alluded to, ‘which contains the concentrated venom of my
malignity,’ is, that I have admitted that there are tyrants and slaves
abroad in the world; and you would hush the matter up, and pretend
that there is no such thing, in order that there may be nothing
else. Farther, I have explained the cause, the subtle sophistry of
the human mind, that tolerates and pampers the evil, in order to
guard against its approaches; you would conceal the cause in order
to prevent the cure, and to leave the proud flesh about the heart to
harden and ossify into one impenetrable mass of selfishness and
hypocrisy, that we may not ‘sympathise in the distresses of suffering
virtue’ in any case, in which they come in competition with the
factitious wants and ‘imputed weaknesses of the great.’ You ask
‘are we gratified by the cruelties of Domitian or Nero?’ No, not
we—they were too petty and cowardly to strike the imagination at
a distance; but the Roman Senate tolerated them, addressed their
perpetrators, exalted them into Gods, the Fathers of their people;
they had pimps and scribblers of all sorts in their pay, their Senecas,
etc. till a turbulent rabble thinking that there were no injuries to
society greater than the endurance of unlimited and wanton oppression,
put an end to the farce, and abated the nuisance as well as
they could. Had you and I lived in those times, we should have
been what we are now, I ‘a sour mal-content,’ and you ‘a sweet
courtier.’ Your reasoning is ill put together; it wants sincerity, it
wants ingenuity. To prove that I am wrong in saying that the love
of power and heartless submission to it extend beyond the tragic
stage to real life, to prove that there has been nothing heard but
the shepherd’s pipe upon the mountain, and that the still sad music
of humanity has never filled up the pauses to the thoughtful ear, you
bring in illustration the cruelties of Domitian and Nero, whom you
suppose to have been without flatterers, train-bearers, or executioners,
and ‘the crimes of revolutionary France of a still blacker die,’ (a
sentence which alone would have entitled you to a post of honour
and secrecy under Sejanus,) which you suppose to have been without
aiders or abettors. You speak of the horrors of Robespierre’s
reign; (there you tread on velvet;) do you mean that these
atrocities excited nothing but horror in revolutionary France, in
undelivered France, in Paris, the centre and focus of anarchy and
crime; or that the enthusiasm and madness with which they were
acted and applauded, was owing to nothing but a long-deferred
desire for truth and justice, and the collected vengeance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>human race? You do not mean this, for you never mean anything
that has even an approximation to unfashionable truth in it.
You add, ‘We cannot recollect, however, that these crimes were
heard of with much satisfaction in this country.’ Then you have
forgotten the years 1793 and 94, you have forgotten the addresses
against republicans and levellers, you have forgotten Mr. Burke and
his 80,000 incorrigible Jacobins.—‘Nor had we the misfortune to
know any individual, (though we will not take upon us to deny
that Mr. Hazlitt may have been of that description,)’ (I will take
upon me to deny that) ‘who cried havoc, and enjoyed the atrocities
of Robespierre and Carnot.’ Then at that time, Sir, you had not
the good fortune to know Mr. Southey.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To return, you find fault with my toleration of those pleasant
persons, Lucio, Pompey, and Master Froth, in Measure for Measure,
and with my use of the word ‘natural morality.’ And yet, ‘the
word is a good word, being whereby a man may be accommodated.’
If Pompey was a common bawd, you, Sir, are a court pimp. That
is artificial morality. ‘Go to, a feather turns the scale of your
avoir-du-pois.’ I have also, it seems, erred in using the term <em>moral</em>
in a way not familiar to you, as opposed to <em>physical</em>; and in that
sense have applied it to the description of the mole on Imogen’s
neck, ‘cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops i’ th’ bottom of a
cowslip.’ I have stated that there is more than a physical—there is
a moral beauty in this image, and I think so still, though you may
not comprehend how.</p>

<p class='c000'>You assert roundly that there is no such person as the black
prince Morocchius,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a> in the Merchant of Venice. ‘He, (Mr. Hazlitt,)
objects entirely to a personage of whom we never heard before, the
black Prince Marocchius. With this piece of blundering ignorance,
<em>which, with</em> a thousand similar instances of his intimate acquaintance
with the poet, clearly <em>prove</em> that his enthusiasm for Shakespear is
all affected, we conclude what we have to say of his folly; it remains
to say a few words of his mischief.’ Vol. xxxiv. p. 463. I could
not at first, Sir, comprehend your drift in this passage, and I can
scarcely believe it yet. But I perceive that in Chalmers’s edition,
the tawny suitor of Portia, who is called Morocchius in my common
edition, goes by the style and title of Morocco. This important
discovery proves, according to you, that my admiration of Shakespear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>is all affected, and that I can know nothing of the poet or
his characters. So that the only title to admiration in Shakespear,
not only in the Merchant of Venice, but in his other plays, all knowledge
of his beauties, or proof of an intimate acquaintance with his
genius, is confined to the alteration which Mr. Chalmers has adopted
in the termination of the two last syllables of the name of this
blackamoor, and his reading Morocco for Morocchius. Admirable
grammarian, excellent critic! I do not wonder you think nothing of
my Characters of Shakespear’s Plays, when I see what it is that you
really admire and think worth the study in them. No, no, Mr.
Gifford, you shall not persuade me by your broken English and
‘red-lattice phrases,’ that the only thing in Shakespear worth knowing,
was the baptismal name of this Prince of Morocco, or that no
one can admire the author’s plays out of Mr Chalmers’s edition, or
find anything to admire even there, except the new nomenclature of
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</span></i>. If this is not your meaning in the passage
here quoted, I do not know what it is; if it is not, I have done you
great injustice in supposing that it is, for I am sure it cannot mean
anything else so foolish and contemptible. You had begun this
curious paragraph by saying, that ‘I had run through my set of
phrases, and was completely at a stand’; and you bring as a damning
proof of this, a repetition of two phrases. Do you believe that I had
filled 300 pages with the repetition of two phrases? ‘Go, go, you’re
a censorious ill man.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The deliberate hypocrisy of Regan and Gonerill, of which I
spoke, I had explained in the sentence before by a periphrasis to
mean their ‘hypocritical pretensions to virtue.’ If I had no right to
use the word hastily in this absolute sense, you had still less to
confound the meaning of a whole passage. Edmund is indeed ‘a
hypocrite to his father; he is a hypocrite to his brother, and to
Regan and Gonerill’; but he is not a hypocrite to himself. This
is that consummation of hypocrisy of which I spoke, and of which
you ought to know something.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have commenced my observations on Lear, you say, with ‘an
acknowledgment remarkable for its <em>naiveté</em> and its truth’; the
import of which remarkable acknowledgment is, that I find myself
incompetent to do justice to this tragedy, by any criticism upon it.
This you construe into a ‘determination on my part to write
nonsense’; you seem, Sir, to have sat down with a determination to
write something worse than nonsense. As a proof of my having
fulfilled the promise, (which I had <em>not</em> made,) you cite these words,
‘It is then the best of all Shakespear’s plays, for it is the one in
which he was <em>most in earnest</em>‘; and add significantly, ‘Macbeth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>Othello were mere <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</span></i>, we presume.’ You may presume so,
but not from what I have said. You only aim at being a word-catcher,
and fail even in that. In like manner, you say, ‘If this
means that we sympathise so much with the feelings and sentiments
of Hamlet, that we identify ourselves with the character, we have to
accuse Mr. Hazlitt of strangely misleading us a few pages back.
“The moral of <cite>Othello</cite> comes directly home to the business and
bosoms of men; the interest in <cite>Hamlet</cite> is more <em>remote</em> and reflex.”
And yet it is we who are Hamlet.’—Yes, because we sympathise
with Hamlet, in the way I have explained, and which you ought to
have endeavoured at least to understand, as reflecting and moralising
on the general distresses of human life, and not as particularly affected
by those which come home to himself, as we see in Othello. You
accuse me of stringing words together without meaning, and it is you
who cannot connect two ideas together.</p>

<p class='c000'>You call me ‘a poor cankered creature,’ ‘a trader in sedition,’ ‘a
wicked sophist,’ and yet you would have it believed that I am ‘principally
distinguished by an <em>indestructible</em> love of flowers and odours,
and dews and clear waters, and soft airs and sounds and bright skies,
and woodland solitudes and moonlight bowers.’<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a> I do not understand
how you reconcile such ‘welcome and unwelcome things,’ but
anything will do to feed your spleen at another’s expence, when it is
the person and not the thing you dislike. Thus you complain of my
style, that it is at times figurative, at times poetical, at times familiar,
not always the same flat dull thing that you would have it. You
point out the omission of a line in a quotation from a well-known
passage in Shakespear. You do not however think the detection of
this omission is a sufficient proof of your sagacity, but you proceed to
assign as a motive for it, ‘That I do it to improve the metre,’ which
is ridiculous. You say I conjure up objections to Shakespear which
nobody ever thought of, in order to answer them. The objection
to Romeo and Juliet, which I have answered, was made by the late
Mr. Curran, as well as the objection to the want of interest and
action in Paradise Lost, which I have answered in another place.—‘Thus
he endeavours to convince one class of critics, that the
poet’s genius was not confined to the production of stage effect by
supernatural means. In another place he expresses his astonishment
that Shakespear should be considered as a gloomy writer, who
painted nothing but gorgons, hydras, and chimeras dire.’ One of
these classes of critics which, you say, ‘are phantoms of my own
creating,’ comprehends the whole French nation, and the other the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>greatest part of the English with Dr. Johnson at their head, who in
his Preface, ‘one of the most perfect pieces of criticism since the
days of Quintilian’ (and which might have been written in the days
of Quintilian just as well as in ours) has neglected to expatiate on
Shakespear’s ‘<em>indestructible</em> love of flowers and odours, and woodland
solitudes and moonlight bowers.’ You know nothing of Shakespear,
nor of what is thought about him: you mind only the text of the commentators.
With respect to Mr. Wordsworth’s Ode, which I have
dragged into my account of Romeo and Juliet, I did not quarrel with
the poetical conceit, but with the metaphysical doctrine founded upon
it by his school. There is a difference between ‘ends of verse and
sayings of philosophers.’ If Shakespear had been a great German
transcendental philosopher (either at the first or second hand) his
talking of the music of the spheres might have rendered him suspected.
You compare my account of Hamlet to the dashing style of
a showman: I think the showman’s speech is proper to a show, and
mine to Hamlet. You, Sir, have no sympathy in common with
Hamlet; nothing to make him seem ever ‘present to your mind’s eye’;
no feeling to produce such an hallucination in your mind, nor to make
you tolerate it in others. You are an Ultra-Crepidarian critic.</p>

<p class='c000'>You laugh at my theory, that ‘Filch’s picking of pockets has
ceased to be so good a jest as formerly,’ from the degeneracy of the
age, that is, from the diminution of the practice, as at variance with
the Police Report. Shortly after I had hazarded this piece of
conjectural criticism, the Beggar’s Opera was hooted off the stage in
America—because they have no Police Report there. I may have
been premature in applying this conclusion from a highly advanced
state of civilization, or from the degeneracy of the age we live in, to
our own country.</p>

<p class='c000'>What you say of my remarks on the use which Shakespear makes
of the principal analogy in Cymbeline, and of contrast in Macbeth is
beneath an answer. You should confine yourself to mere matters of
verbal criticism. Thus you object to my use of the term ‘logical
diagrams’ as unprecedented and barbarous: yet we talk of syllogising
in mode and figure, and besides, the word has been made pretty
malleable by Mr. Burke. What do you say to his talking of ‘the
geometricians and chemists of France, bringing the one from the dry
bones of their diagrams, and the other from the soot of their furnaces,
dispositions worse than indifferent to common feelings and habitudes.’
Would you call this ‘slip-slop absurdity’? But to talk of <em>the dry bones
of diagrams</em>, and escape with impunity from the censure of small critics,
a man must assert that the king of this country ‘holds his crown in
contempt of the choice of the people.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>I am obliged to you for informing me of the real name of the
person who wrote the ingenious parallel between Richard the Third
and Macbeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The article in the last Review on my Lectures on English Poetry,
requires a very short notice.—You would gladly retract what you
have said, but you dare not. You are a coward to public opinion and
to your own. You begin by observing, ‘Mr. Hazlitt seems to have
bound himself like Hannibal to wage everlasting war, not indeed
against Rome, but against accurate reasoning, just observation, and
precise, or even intelligible language.’ This might be true, if the
opinion of the Quarterly Review were synonymous with accurate
reasoning, just observation, and knowledge of language. ‘We have
traced him in his two former predatory excursions on taste and
common sense. Had he written on any other subject, we should
scarcely have thought of watching his movements.’ You were
‘principally excited to notice’ the Round Table by some political
heresies which had crept into it: you ‘condescended to notice’ the
Characters of Shakespear’s Plays, ‘to shew how small a portion of
talent and literature was necessary to carry on the trade of sedition.’
You have been tempted to watch my movements in the present work
to shew how little talent and literature is necessary to write a popular
work on poetry. ‘But though his book is dull, his theme is pleasing,
and interests in spite of the author. As we read, we forget Mr.
Hazlitt, to think of those concerning whom he writes.’ Do you
think, Sir, that a higher compliment could come from you?</p>

<p class='c000'>It would neither be for my credit nor your own, that I should
follow you in detail through your abortive attempts to deny me
exactly those qualifications which you feel conscious that I possess,
or afraid that others will ascribe to me. You are already bankrupt
of your word, nor can I be admitted as an evidence in my own case.
You say that I am utterly without originality, without a power of
illustration, or language to make myself understood!—I shall leave it
to the public to judge between us. There is one objection however
which you make to me which is singular enough: viz. that I quote
Shakespear. I can only answer, that ‘I would not change that vice
for your best virtue.’ ‘If a trifling thing is to be told, he will not
mention it in common language: he must give it, if possible, in words
which the Bard of Avon has <em>somewhere</em> used. Were <em>the beauty of
the applications conspicuous</em>, we might forget or at least forgive, <em>the
deformity</em> produced <em>by the constant stitching in of these patches</em>‘—[<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> by
the beauty of the applications]. ‘Unfortunately, however, the
phrases thus obtruded upon us <em>seem</em> to be selected, not on account of
<em>any intrinsic beauty</em>, but merely because they are <em>fantastic and unlike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>what would naturally occur to an ordinary writer</em>.’ Certainly, Sir,
your style is very different from Shakespear’s. I observe in your
notes to the Baviad and Mæviad, you diversify your matter by
frequently quoting Greek.—Now it appears to me that these quotations
of your’s add to the wit only by varying the type. If these
learned patches ‘plagued the Cruscas and Lauras,’ my quotations
have given other people ‘the horrors’!</p>

<p class='c000'>You quote my definition of poetry, and say that it is not a definition
of anything, because it is completely unintelligible. To prove this,
you take one word which occurs in it, and is no way important, the
word <em>sympathy</em>, which you tell us has two significations, one anatomical,
and the other moral; and poetry, according to you, ‘has no skill in
surgery or ethics.’ I do not think this shews a want of clearness in
my definition, but a want of good faith or understanding in you.</p>

<p class='c000'>You say that I get at a number of extravagant conclusions ‘by means
sufficiently simple and common. He employs the term poetry in
three distinct meanings, and his legerdemain consists in substituting
one of these for the other. Sometimes it is the general appellation of
a certain class of compositions, as when he says that poetry is graver
than history. Secondly, it denotes the talent by which these compositions
are produced; and it is in this sense that he calls poetry
that fine particle within us, which produces in our being rarefaction,
expansion, elevation and purification.’ [This is Mr. Gifford’s
academic style, not mine.] ‘Thirdly, it denotes the subjects of
which these compositions treat. It is in this meaning that he uses
the term, when he says that all that is worth remembering in life is
the poetry of it; that fear is poetry, that hope is poetry, that love
is poetry; and in the very same sense he might assert that fear
is sculpture and painting and music; that the crimes of Verres are
the eloquence of Cicero, and the poetry of Milton the criticism of
Mr. Hazlitt.’ It is true I have used the word poetry in the three
senses above imputed to me, and I have done so, because the word
has these three <em>distinct</em> meanings in the English language, that is, it
signifies the composition produced, the state of mind or faculty
producing it, and, in certain cases, the subject-matter proper to call
forth that state of mind. Your objection amounts to this, that in
reasoning on a difficult question I write common English, and this
is the whole secret of my extravagance and obscurity.—Do you
mean that the distinguishing between the compositions of poetry, the
talent for poetry, or the subject-matter of poetry, would have told us
what <em>poetry</em> is? This is what you would say, or you have no meaning
at all. I have expressly treated the subject according to this
very division, and I have endeavoured to define that common something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>which belongs to these several views of it, and determines us
in the application of the same common name, viz. an unusual vividness
in external objects or in our immediate impressions, exciting a
movement of imagination in the mind, and leading by natural association
or <em>sympathy</em> to harmony of sound and the modulation of verse in
expressing it. This is what you, Sir, cannot understand. I could
not ‘assert in the same sense that fear is sculpture and painting, etc.’
because this would be an abuse of the English language: we talk of
the <em>poetry of painting</em>, etc. which could not be, if poetry was confined
to the technical sense of ‘lines in ten syllables.’ The crimes
of Verres, I also grant, were not the same thing as the eloquence of
Cicero, though I suspect you confound the crimes of revolutionary
France with Mr. Pitt’s speeches; and as to Milton’s poetry and my
criticisms, there is almost as much difference between them as
between Milton’s poetry and your verses. You say, ‘the principal
subjects of which poetry treats, are the passions and affections of
mankind; we are all under the influence of our passions and affections,
that is, in Mr. Hazlitt’s new language, we all act on the
principles of poetry, and are in truth all poets. We all exert our
muscles and limbs, therefore we are anatomists and surgeons; we
have teeth which we employ in chewing, therefore we are dentists,’
etc. Not at all; we are all poets, inasmuch as we are under the
influence of the passions and imagination, that is, as we have certain
common feelings, and undergo the same process of mind with the
poet, who only expresses in a particular manner what he and all feel
alike; but in exerting our muscles, we do not dissect them; in
chewing with our teeth, we do not perform the part of dentists, etc.
There is nothing parallel in the two cases. ‘You anticipate,’ you
say, ‘these brilliant conclusions for me’; and do not perceive the
difference between the extension of a logical principle, and an abuse
of common language.—You proceed, ‘As another specimen of his
definitions, we may take the following. “Poetry does not define the
limits of sense, nor analyse the distinctions of the understanding, but
signifies the excess of the imagination beyond the actual or ordinary
impression of any object or feeling.” Poetry was at the beginning
of the book asserted to be <em>an impression</em>; it is now <em>the excess of the
imagination beyond an impression</em>; what this excess is we cannot tell,
but at least it must be something very unlike an impression.’ Poetry
at the beginning of the book was asserted to be not simply an
impression, ‘but an impression <em>by its vividness exciting an involuntary
movement of the imagination</em>: now, you say it is <em>the excess of the
imagination beyond an impression</em>; and you bring this as a proof of a
contradiction in terms. An impression, by its vividness exciting a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>movement of the imagination, you discover, must be something very
unlike an impression, and as to the imagination itself, you cannot tell
what it is; it is an unknown power in your poetical creed. What is
most extraordinary is, that you had quoted the very passage which
you here represent as a total contradiction to the latter, only two
pages before. What, Sir, do you think of your readers? What
must they think of you!—‘Though the <em>total want of meaning</em>,’ you
add, ‘is the weightiest objection to such writing, yet <em>the abuse</em> which
it involves of <em>particular words and phrases</em>’ (in addition to a total
want of meaning) ‘is very remarkable,’ (it must be so,) ‘and will
not be overlooked by those who are aware of the inseparable connexion
between justness of thought and precision of language.’
(You are not aware that there is no precise measure of thought or
expression.) ‘What, in strict reasoning, can be meant by the
impression of a feeling?’ (The impression which it makes on the
mind, as distinct from some other to which it gives birth, is what I
meant.) ‘How can <em>actual</em> and <em>ordinary</em> be used as synonymous?’
(They are not.) ‘Every impression must be an actual impression’;
(there is then no such thing as an imaginary impression;) ‘and the
use of that epithet annihilates the limitations which Mr. Hazlitt
meant’ (in the total want of all meaning,) ‘to guard his proposition.’
<em>We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us.</em> You say,
‘you have not the faintest conception of what I mean by the heavenly
bodies returning on the squares of the distances or on Dr. Chalmers’s
Discourses.’ Nor will I tell you what I meant. <em>A knavish speech
sleeps in a fool’s ear.</em> ‘As to the assertion that there can never be
another Jacob’s dream, we see no reason why dreams should be
scientific.’ Shakespear says, that dreams ‘<em>denote a foregone conclusion</em>.’
You quote what I say of Swift, and misrepresent it.
‘Mr. Hazlitt’s doctrine, therefore, is, that the inability to become
mad, is very likely to drive a man mad.’ My doctrine is, that the
inability to get rid of a favourite idea, when constantly thwarted, or
of the impression of any object, however painful, merely because it is
true, is likely to drive a man mad. It is this tenaciousness on a
particular point that almost always destroys the general coherence of
the understanding. I do not say that the inability to get rid of the
distinction between right and wrong continued in Swift’s mind after
he was mad—I say it contributed to drive him mad. I mean that a
sense of great injustice often produces madness in individual cases,
and that a strong sense of general injustice, and an abstracted view of
human nature such as it is, compared with what it ought to be, is
likely to produce the same effect in a mind like that of the author of
Gulliver’s Travels. Do you understand yet? You do not go into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>my general character of Swift, which might have drawn you into
something of a wider field of speculation; and you pick out a straggling
sentence or two to cavil at in my account of Pope, of Chaucer,
of Milton, and Shakespear, on which you are glad to discharge the
gall that has been accumulating in your mind for several pages. If
you think by this means, to put me or the public out of conceit with
my writings, you have mistaken the matter entirely. You can only
put down my arguments by meeting them fairly, or my style, by
writing better than you do.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘We occasionally,’ you proceed, ‘discover a faint semblance of
connected thinking in Mr. Hazlitt’s pages; but wherever this is the
case, his reasoning is for the most part incorrect.’ This is a curious
inference. ‘This faint semblance of connected thinking,’ is, it
appears, when I maintain some opinion, which is ‘a sprout from
some popular doctrine’; but if I push it a little farther than you
were aware of, my reasoning becomes incorrect. Thus it has been a
popular doctrine with some critics, (which yet you do not admit)—‘That
the progress of science is unfavourable to the culture of the
imagination. It is no doubt true, that the individual who devotes his
labour to the investigation of abstract truth, must acquire habits of
thought very different from those which the exercise of the fancy
demands.’ You add in italics, ‘<em>the cause lies in the exclusive appropriation
of his time to reasoning, and not in the logical accuracy with
which he reasons</em>.’ Whenever I have any discovery to communicate,
which I think you cannot comprehend, I will in future put it in italics,
to make it equally profound and clear. It appears by you, that the
incompatibility between the successful pursuit of different studies does
not arise from anything incompatible in the studies themselves, but
from the time devoted to each. The mind is equally incapacitated
from passing from one to the other, whether they are the most
opposite or the most alike. The dreams of alchemy, and the schemes
of astrology, the traditional belief in the doctrine of ghosts and fairies,
though made up almost entirely of imagination, self-will, superstition
and romance, were not a jot more favourable to the caprices and
fanciful exaggerations of poetry, either in the public mind, or in that
of individuals, than the modern system which excludes (both by the
logical accuracy with which it proceeds, and a constant appeal to
demonstrable facts), every alloy of passion, and all exercise of the
imagination. You should never put your thoughts in italics. If I
were to attempt a character of verbal critics, I should be apt to say,
that their habits of mind disqualify them for general reasoning or fair
discussion: that they are furious about trifles, because they have
nothing else to interest them; that they have no way of giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>dignity to their insignificant discoveries, but by treating those who
have missed them with contempt; that they are dogmatical and
conceited, in proportion as they have little else to guide them in
their quaint researches but caprice and accident; that the want of
intellectual excitement gives birth to increasing personal irritability,
and endless petty altercation. You, Sir, would make all this self-evident,
by the help of italics, and say, that <em>the cause lies not in anything
in the nature of verbal criticism, but the exclusive appropriation of
their time to it</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>You next run foul of my account of the pleasure derived from
tragedy. You are afraid to understand what I say on any subject,
and it is not therefore likely you should ever detect what is erroneous
in it. I have shewn by a reference to facts, and to the authority of
Mr. Burke (whom you would rather contradict than believe me)
that the objects which are supposed to please only in fiction, please in
reality; that ‘if there were known to be a public execution of some state
criminal in the next street, the theatre would soon be empty’—that
therefore the pleasure derived from tragedy is not anything peculiar
to it, as poetry or fiction; but has its ground in the common love
of strong excitement. You say, I have misstated the fact, to give a
false view of the question, which, according to you, is ‘why that
which is painful in itself, pleases in works of fiction.’ I answer,
I have shewn that this is not a fair statement of the question, by
stating the fact, that what is painful in itself, pleases not the sufferer
indeed, but the spectator, in reality as well as in works of fiction.
The common proverb proves it—‘What is sport to one, is death to
another.’</p>

<p class='c000'>You observe, that ‘Some lines I have quoted from Chaucer, are
very pleasing—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>——“Emelie that fayrer was to sene</div>
      <div class='line'>Than is the lilie upon his stalke grene,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fresher than the May with floures newe:</div>
      <div class='line'>For with the rose-colour strove hire hewe;</div>
      <div class='line'>I n’ot which was the finer of hem too.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>‘But surely the beauty does not lie in the last line, though it is
with this that Mr. Hazlitt is chiefly struck. “This scrupulousness”
he observes, “about the literal preference, as if some question of
matter of fact were at issue, is remarkable.”’</p>

<p class='c000'>That is, I am not chiefly struck with the beauty of the last line,
but with its peculiarity as characteristic of Chaucer. The beauty of
the former lines might be in Spenser: the scrupulous exactness of
the latter could be found nowhere but in Chaucer. I had said just
before, that this poet ‘introduces a sentiment or a simile, as if it were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>given in upon evidence.’ I bring this simile as an instance in point,
and you say I have not brought it to prove something else.</p>

<p class='c000'>You charge me with misrepresenting Longinus, and prove that I
have not. The word <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ἐναγώνιον</span> signifies not as you are pleased to
paraphrase it ‘vehemently energetic,’ but simply ‘full of contests.’
Must the Greek language be new-fangled, to prove that I am ignorant
of it?</p>

<p class='c000'>The only mistake you are able to point out, is a slip of the pen,
which you will find to have been corrected long ago in the second
edition.—Your pretending to say that Dr. Johnson was an admirer
of Milton’s blank verse, is not a slip of the pen—you know he was
not. There is as little sincerity in your concluding paragraph. You
would ascribe what little appearance of thought there is in my writings
to a confusion of images, and what appearance there is of imagination
to a gaudy phraseology. If I had neither words nor ideas, I should
be a profound philosopher and critic. How fond you are of reducing
every one else to your own standard of excellence!</p>

<p class='c000'>I have done what I promised. You complain of the difficulty of
remembering what I write; possibly this Letter will prove an exception.
There is a train of thought in your own mind, which will
connect the links together: and before you again undertake to run
down a writer for no other reason, than that he is of an opposite
party to yourself, you will perhaps recollect that your wilful artifices
and shallow cunning, though they pass undetected, will hardly screen
you from your own contempt, nor, when once exposed, will the gratitude
of your employers save you from public scorn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your conduct to me is no new thing: it is part of a system which
has been regularly followed up for many years. Mr. Coleridge, in
his Literary Life, has the following passage to shew the treatment
which he and his friends received from your predecessor, the editor
of the Anti-Jacobin Review.—‘I subjoin part of a note from the
Beauties of the Anti-Jacobin, in which having previously informed
the public that I had been dishonoured at Cambridge for preaching
Deism, at a time when for my youthful ardour in defence of Christianity
I was decried as a bigot by the proselytes of French philosophy,
the writer concludes with these words—“<em>Since this time he has left his
native country, commenced citizen of the world, left his poor children
fatherless, and his wife destitute. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex hoc disce</span> his friends, Lamb and
Southey.</em>” With severest truth,’ continues Mr. Coleridge, ‘it may
be asserted that it would not be easy to select two men more exemplary
in their domestic affections than those whose names were thus
printed at full length, as in the same rank of morals with a denounced
infidel and fugitive, who had left his children fatherless, and his wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>destitute! <em>Is it surprising that many good men remained longer than
perhaps they otherwise would have done, adverse to a party which
encouraged and openly rewarded the authors of such atrocious calumnies?</em>’</p>

<p class='c000'>With me, I confess, the wonder does not lie there:—all I am
surprised at is, that the objects of these atrocious calumnies were ever
reconciled to the authors of them and their patrons. Doubtless, they
had powerful arts of conversion in their hands, who could with
impunity and in triumph take away by atrocious calumnies the characters
of all who disdained to be their tools; and rewarded with
honours, places, and pensions all those who were. It is in this
manner, Sir, that some of my old friends have become your new
allies and associates.—They have changed sides, not I; and the
proof that I have been true to the original ground of quarrel is, that
I have you against me. Your consistency is the undeniable pledge
of their tergiversation. The instinct of self-interest and meanness
of servility are infallible and safe; it is speculative enthusiasm and
disinterested love of public good, that being the highest strain of
humanity, are apt to falter, and ‘dying, make a swan-like end.’
This tendency to change was, in the case of our poetical reformists,
precipitated by another cause. The spirit of poetry is, as I believe,
favourable to liberty and humanity, but not when its aid is most
wanted, in encountering the shocks and disappointments of the
world. Poetry may be described as having the range of the
universe; it traverses the empyrean, and looks down on nature from
a higher sphere. When it lights upon the earth, it loses some of
its dignity and its use. Its strength is in its wings; its element
is the air. Standing on its feet, jostling with the crowd, it is liable
to be overthrown, trampled on, and defaced; for its wings are of a
dazzling brightness, ‘sky-tinctured,’ and the least soil upon them
shews to disadvantage. Sullied, degraded as I have seen it, I shall
not here insult over it, but leave it to Time to take out the stains,
seeing it is a thing immortal as itself. ‘Being so majestical, I should
do it wrong to offer it but the shew of violence.’—The reason why
I have not changed my principles with some of the persons here
alluded to, is, that I had a natural inveteracy of understanding which
did not bend to fortune or circumstances. I was not a poet, but a
metaphysician; and I suspect that the conviction of an abstract principle
is alone a match for the prejudices of absolute power. The
love of truth is the best foundation for the love of liberty. In this
sense, I might have repeated—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>Besides, I had another reason. I owed something to truth, for
she had done something for me. Early in life I had made (what
I thought) a metaphysical discovery; and after that, it was too late to
think of retracting. My pride forbad it: my understanding revolted
at it. I could not do better than go on as I had begun. I too, worshipped
at no unhallowed shrine, and served in no mean presence. I
had laid my hand on the ark, and could not turn back! I have been
called ‘a writer of third-rate books.’ For myself, there is no work
of mine which I should rate so high, except one, which I dare say you
never heard of—An Essay on the Principles of Human Action. I do
not think the worse of it on that account; nor though you might not
be able to understand it, could you attribute this to the gaudiness of the
phraseology, nor the want of thought. I will here, Sir, explain the
nature of the argument as clearly and in as few words as I can.</p>

<p class='c000'>The object of that Essay (and I have written this Letter partly
to introduce it through you to the notice of the reader) is to leave
free play to the social affections, and to the cultivation of the more
disinterested and generous principles of our nature, by removing a
stumbling-block which has been thrown in their way, and which
turns the very idea of virtue or humanity into a fable, viz. the metaphysical
doctrine of the innate and necessary selfishness of the human
mind. Do you understand so far? The question I propose to
examine is not the practical question, how far man is more or less
selfish or social in the actual sum-total of his habits and affections,
nor the moral or political question, to what degree of perfection he
can be advanced still further in the one, or weaned from the other;
but my intention is to state and answer the previous question, whether
there is, as it has been contended, a total incapacity and physical
impossibility in the human mind, of feeling an interest in anything
beyond itself, so that both the common feelings of compassion,
natural affection, friendship, etc. and the more refined and abstracted
ones of the love of justice, of country, or of kind, are, and must be
a delusion, believed in only by fools, and turned to their advantage
by knaves. This doctrine which has been sedulously and confidently
maintained by the French and English metaphysicians of the two
last centuries, by Hobbes, Mandeville, Rochefoucault, Helvetius
and others, and is a principal corner-stone of what is called the
modern philosophy, I think tends to, and has done a great deal of
mischief, and I believe I have found out a view of the subject, which
gets rid of it unanswerably and for ever, in manner and form following.
I conceive, that to establish the doctrine of exclusive and
absolute selfishness on a metaphysical basis, that is to say, on the
original and impassable distinction of the faculties of the human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>mind, it is necessary to make it appear, that there is some peculiar
and abstracted principle which gives it an immediate, mechanical, and
irresistible interest in whatever relates to itself, and which by the
same rule shuts out and is a bar to the very possibility of our feeling
not an equal, but any kind or degree of interest whatever, at any
moment of our lives, in the history and fate of others. This is so
far from being true, that the contrary is demonstrable. Thus, Sir,
My self-interest in anything signifies (by the statement) the particular
manner in which whatever relates to myself affects me, so as
to create an anxiety about it, and be a motive to action. Now the
same word, <em>self</em>, is indifferently applied to the whole of my being,
past, present, and to come; and it is supposed from the use of
language and the habitual association of ideas, that this self is <em>one
thing</em> as well as one word, and my interest in it all along the same
necessary, identical interest. That a man must love himself as such,
seems a self-evident and simple proposition. The idea appears like
an absolute truth, and resists every attempt at analysis, like an element
in nature. Some persons, who formerly took the pains to read this
work, imagined (do not be alarmed, Sir!) that I wanted to argue
them out of their own existence, merely because I endeavoured to
define the nature and meaning of this word, self; to take in pieces,
by metaphysical aid, this fine illusion of the brain and forgery of
language, and to shew what there is real, and what false in it. The
word denotes, by common consent, three different selves, my past,
my present, and my future self. Now it is taken for granted by
some, and insisted upon by others, that I must have the same unavoidable
interest in all these, because they are all equally myself.
But that is impossible; for in truth my personal identity is founded
only on my personal consciousness, and that does not extend beyond
the present moment.—It must be maintained, on the other side of
the question, that my past, my present, and my future self are inseparably
linked together, equally identified by an intimate communion of
transferable thoughts and feelings in one metaphysical principle of self-interest,
before they can be equally myself, the same identical thing, to
any purpose of sentiment or for any motive of action. It will easily
be seen how far this is the case, and how far it is not. I have a
peculiar, exclusive self-interest or sympathy (never mind the word,
Sir,) with my present self, by means of sensation (or consciousness),
and with my past self, by means of memory, which I have not, and
cannot have with the past or present feelings or interests of others;
for this reason that these faculties are exclusive, peculiar, and confined
to myself. But I have no exclusive, or peculiar, or independent
faculty, like sensation or memory, giving me the same absolute,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>unavoidable, instinctive interest in my own future sensations, and none
at all in those of others. This ideal self is then nominally the same,
but strictly different; composed of distinct and unequal parts; bound
together by laws and principles which have no parity of relation to
each other. By shewing how personal identity produces self-interest
as far as it goes, we shall see exactly when and how it ceases.—If
I touch a burning coal, this gives me a present sensation differing
in kind and degree from any impression I can receive from the
same sensation being inflicted on another: there is no communication
between another’s nerves and my brain producing a correspondent
jar and magnetic sympathy of frame. Again, if I have suffered
a pain of this sort in time past, this leaves traces in my mind, by my
continued identity with myself, or by means of memory, of a kind
totally distinct from any conception I can form of the same pain
inflicted a year ago (for instance) on another. These two important
faculties then give me an appropriate and exclusive interest only in
what happens or has happened to myself. So far as the operation of
these two faculties goes, I am strictly a selfish being, I am necessarily
cut off from all knowledge of or sympathy with the feelings of any
one but myself. But if I am to undergo a certain pain at a future
time, the next year or the next moment, however near or remote, I
have no faculty impressing this feeling intuitively and with mechanical
force and certainty on my mind beforehand, as my present or past
impressions are stamped upon it by means of sensation and memory.
I have no principle of thought or sentiment in the original conformation
of my mind, projecting me forward into my future being, giving
me a present unavoidable consciousness of it, and removed from all
cognisance of what happens to others; I have no faculty identifying
my future interests inseparably with my present feelings, and therefore
I have no exclusive, mechanical and proper self-interest in them,
merely because they are mine: for that which is <em>mine</em>, is that which
touches me by secret springs, and in a way in which what relates to
others can take no hold of me. The only faculty by which I can
anticipate what is to befal myself in future, is the same common and
disposable faculty in kind and in mode of operation, by which I can,
I do, and must anticipate in degree, and more or less according to
circumstances, the feelings and thoughts of others, and take a proportionable
interest in them, viz. the Imagination. To suppose that
there is a principle of self-interest in the mind, without a faculty
of self-interest, is an absurdity and a contradiction. This idea of
an abstract, exclusive, metaphysical self-interest in my own being
generally, is taken (by a gross and blind prejudice) from the manner
in which the faculties of sensation and memory affect me, and applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>to a part of my being, where I have no such interest in myself,
because I have no such faculty giving it me. What proves that there is
no mechanical sympathy identifying my future with my present being,
is, that I am for the most part, indifferent to, ignorant of what is to
happen to myself hereafter. There is no presentiment in the case.
If the house is about to fall on my head, this occasions no uneasiness
to my self-love, unless there are circumstances to alarm my imagination
beforehand. To suppose, that besides the ideal or rational
interest I have in the event, I have another <em>real</em> metaphysical interest
in it, without object or consciousness, is as if I should say, that I
have a particular interest in the past, without remembering it, or in
the present without feeling it.—But the future is the only subject of
action, that is, of a practical or rational interest at all, either of self-love
or benevolence. All voluntary action, that is, all action undertaken
with a view to produce a certain event or the contrary, must
relate to the future. The primary, essential motive of the volition of
anything must be the <em>idea</em> of that thing, and the idea solely. For the
thing itself, which is the object of desire and pursuit, is by the
supposition a nonentity. It is <em>willed</em> for that very reason, that it is
supposed not to exist. If it did exist, or had existed, it would be
absurd to will it to exist or not to exist; and as a thing which does
not exist, but which we will to be or not to be, it is a mere fiction of
the mind, and can exert no power over the thoughts, nor influence
the will or the affections in any way, except through the imagination.
The future, whether as it relates to myself or others, exists
only in the mind; and in the mind, not by memory, not by sensation,
which are exclusive and selfish faculties, but by the imagination,
which is not a limited, narrow faculty, but common, discursive, and
social. If my sympathy with others is not a sensible substantial
mechanical interest, neither is my self-interest anything but an imaginary
and ideal one, I am bound to my future interest only by
the same fine links of fancy and reason, which give that of others a
hold on my affections. As a voluntary agent, I am necessarily, and
in the first instance, that is, in the metaphysical sense of the question,
a disinterested one. I could not love myself, if I were not so formed,
as to be capable of loving others. I have no solid, material, gross,
actual self-interest in my own future welfare, and I therefore can only
have the same airy, notional, hypothetical interest in it, which I
must have in kind, though not in degree, in the pleasures and pains
of others, which I get at the knowledge of and sympathise with in
the same way. There is then no exclusive ground of self-interest,
incompatible with sympathy, and rendering it a chimera; self-love
and sympathy both rest on the same general ground of reason, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>imagination, and of common sense.—It may be said, that my own
future interests have a reality beyond the mere idea. So have the
interests of others, and the only question is, whether the sympathy,
the motive to action, is not equally imaginary in both cases. It may
be said, that I shall become my future self, but that is no reason why
I should take a particular interest in it till I do. If a pin pricks me
in any part of my body, I am instantly apprised of it, and feel an
interest in removing it; but my future self does not find any means of
apprising me of its sensations, in which I can feel no interest, except
from previous apprehension. Lastly, it may be said that I do feel
an interest in myself and my future welfare, which I do not, and
cannot feel in that of others. This I grant; but that does not prove
a metaphysical antecedent self-interest, precluding the possibility of all
interest in others, (for the social affections are as much a matter of
fact, as the influence of self-love) but a practical self-interest, arising
out of habit and circumstances, and more or less consistent with
other disinterested and humane feelings, according to habit, opinion,
and circumstances. I love myself better than my neighbour,
for the same reason (and for no other) that I love my child better
than a stranger’s—from having my thoughts more fixed upon its
welfare, my time more taken up in providing for it, and from my
knowing better by experience, what its wants and wishes are. People
have accounted for natural affection as an innate idea, as they have
for self-love. According to the metaphysical doctrine of selfishness,
my own child or a stranger’s, and every one else, are equally and
perfectly indifferent to me, as much as if they were mere machines.
As to a paramount universal abstract notion of personal identity,
impelling and overruling all my actions, thoughts, feelings, etc. to one
sole object, and centre of self-interest, there is no such thing in nature.
It requires almost as much pains and discipline, to make us attentive
to our own real and permanent happiness, as to that of others. Is it
not the constant theme of moralists and divines, that man is the sport
of impulse, and the creature of habit? I would ask, whether the
convivialist is deterred from indulging in his love of the bottle, by
any consideration of the ruin of his health or business? Is the
debauchee restrained in the career of his passions, any more by
reflecting on the disgrace or probable diseases he is bringing on
himself, than on the injury he does to others? It would be as hard
a task to make the spendthrift prudent, as the miser generous. Man
is governed by his passions, and not by his interest.—The selfish
theory is founded on mixing up vulgar prejudices, and scholastic distinctions;
and by being insisted on, tends to debase the mind, and
not at all promote the cause of truth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>I do not think I should illustrate the foregoing reasoning so well
by anything I could add on the subject, as by relating the manner in
which it first struck me. I remember I had been reading a speech
which Mirabaud (the author of the work, called the System of
Nature) has put into the mouth of a supposed infidel at the day of
Judgment; and was afterwards led on by some means or other, to
consider the question, whether it could properly be said to be an act
of virtue in any one to sacrifice his own final happiness to that of any
other person, or number of persons, if it were possible for the one
ever to be made the price of the other. Suppose it be my own
case—that it were in my power to save twenty other persons, by
voluntarily consenting to suffer for them, why should I not do a
generous thing, and never trouble myself about what might be the
consequences to myself thousands of years hence? Now the reason,
I thought, why a man should prefer his own future welfare to that of
others, was, that he has a necessary, or abstract interest in the one,
which he cannot have in the other, and this again is the consequence
of his being always the same individual, of his continued identity with
himself. The distinction is this, that however insensible I may be to
my own interest at any future period, yet when the time comes, I
shall feel very differently about it. I shall then judge of it from the
actual impression of the object, that is, truly and certainly; and as I
shall still be conscious of my past feelings, and shall bitterly repent
my own folly and insensibility, I ought, as a rational agent, to be
determined now by what I shall then wish I had done, when I shall
feel the consequences of my actions most deeply and sensibly. It is
this continued consciousness of my own feelings which gives me an
immediate interest in whatever relates to my future welfare, and
makes me at all times accountable to myself for my own conduct.
As therefore this consciousness will be renewed in me after death, if
I exist again at all—But stop——As I must be conscious of my past
feelings to be myself, and as this conscious being will be myself, how,
if that consciousness should be transferred to some other being?
How am I to know that I am not imposed upon by a false claim of
identity? But that is impossible, because I shall have no other self
than that which arises from this very consciousness. Why then, if
so, this self may be multiplied in as many different beings as the
Deity may think proper to endue with the same consciousness, which,
if it can be renewed by an act of omnipotence in any one instance,
may clearly be so in a hundred others. Am I to regard all these as
equally myself? Am I equally interested in the fate of all? Or if I
must fix upon some one of them in particular as my representative and
other self, how am I to be determined in my choice?——Here then I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>saw an end to my speculations about absolute self-interest and personal
identity. I saw plainly, that the consciousness of my own feelings,
which is made the foundation of my continued interest in them, could
not extend to what had never been, and might never be, that my
identity with myself must be confined to the connection between my
past and present being, that with respect to my future feelings and
interests they could have no communication with, or influence over
my present feelings and interests, merely because they were future,
that I shall be hereafter affected by the recollection of my former
feelings and actions, and my remorse be equally heightened by reflecting
on my past folly, and late-earned wisdom, whether I am really
the same thinking being, or have only the same consciousness renewed
in me; but that to suppose that this remorse can re-act in the reverse
order on my present feelings, or create an immediate interest in my
future feelings before it exists, is an express contradiction. For,
how can this pretended unity of consciousness which is only reflected
from the past, which makes me so little acquainted with the future,
that I cannot even tell for a moment how long it will be continued,
whether it will be entirely interrupted by, or renewed in me after
death, and which might be multiplied in I don’t know how many
different beings, and prolonged by complicated sufferings, without my
being any the wiser for it; how, I ask, can a principle of this sort
transfuse my present into my future being, and make me as much a
participator in what does not at all affect me as if it were actually impressed
upon my senses? I cannot, therefore, have a principle of
active self-interest arising out of the connexion between my future and
present being, for no such connexion exists or is possible. I am
what I am in spite of the future. My feelings, actions, and interests
are determined by causes already existing and acting, and cannot
depend on anything else, without a complete transposition of the order
in which effects follow one another in nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this manner, Sir, may a man learn to distinguish the limits
which circumscribe his identity with himself, and the frail tenure on
which he holds his fleeting existence. Here indeed, ‘on this bank
and shoal of time,’ we give ourselves credit for a few years, and so
far make sure of our continued identity—as far as we can see the
horizon before us, while the same busy scene exists, while the same
objects, passions, and pursuits engross our attention, we seem to grasp
the realities of things; they are incorporated with our imagination
and take hold of our affections, and we cannot doubt of our interest
in them. Farther than this, we do not go with the same confidence;
the indistinctness of another state of being takes away its reality, and
we lose the abstract idea of self for want of objects to attach it to. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>the reasoning is the same in both cases. The next year, the
next hour, the next moment is but a creation of the mind; in all
that we hope or fear, love or hate, in all that is nearest and dearest
to us, we but mistake the strength of illusion for certainty, and follow
the mimic shews of things and catch at a shadow and live in a
waking dream. Everything before us exists in an ideal world.
The future is a blank and dreary void, like sleep or death, till the
imagination brooding over it with wings outspread, impregnates it
with life and motion. The forms and colours it assumes are but
the pictures reflected on the eye of fancy, the unreal mockeries
of future events. The solid fabric of time and nature moves on,
but the future always flies before it. The present moment stands on
the brink of nothing. We cannot pass the dread abyss, or make a
broad and beaten way over it, or construct a real interest in it, or
identify ourselves with what is not, or have a being, sense, and
motion, where there are none. Our interest in the future, our
identity with it, cannot be substantial; that self which we project
before us into it is like a shadow in the water, a bubble of the brain.
In becoming the blind and servile drudges of self-interest, we bow
down before an idol of our own making, and are spell-bound by a
name. Those objects to which we are most attached, make no part
of our present sensations or real existence; they are fashioned out of
nothing, and rivetted to our self-love by the force of a reasoning
imagination, (the privilege of our intellectual nature)—and it is the
same faculty that carries us out of ourselves as well as beyond
the present moment, that pictures the thoughts, passions and feelings
of others to us, and interests us in them, that clothes the whole
possible world with a borrowed reality, that breathes into all other
forms the breath of life, and endows our sympathies with vital
warmth, and diffuses the soul of morality through all the relations and
sentiments of our social being.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such, Sir, is the metaphysical discovery of which I spoke; and
which I made many years ago. From that time I felt a certain
weight and tightness about my heart taken off, and cheerful and
confident thoughts springing up in the place of anxious fears and sad
forebodings. The plant I had sown and watered with my tears,
grew under my eye; and the air about it was wholesome and
pleasant. For this cause it is, that I have gone on little discomposed by
other things, by good or adverse fortune, by good or ill report, more
hurt by public disappointments than my own, and not thrown into
the hot or cold fits of a tertian ague; as the Edinburgh or Quarterly
Review damps or raises the opinion of the town in my favour. I
have some love of fame, of the fame of a Pascal, a Leibnitz, or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Berkeley (none at all of popularity) and would rather that a single
inquirer after truth should pronounce my name, after I am dead, with
the same feelings that I have thought of theirs, than be puffed in all
the newspapers, and praised in all the reviews, while I am living.
I myself have been a thinker; and I cannot but believe that there are
and will be others, like me. If the few and scattered sparks of truth,
which I have been at so much pains to collect, should still be kept
alive in the minds of such persons, and not entirely die with me, I
shall be satisfied.</p>

    substance of the paragraph beginning ‘The love of life is, in general, the effect,’ and

    not adhered to. Hazlitt shortly afterwards (1818) delivered a course of Lectures on the

    <dd>In <cite>The Examiner</cite> this essay concluded with the following passage: ‘We do not
    think a classical education proper for women. It may pervert their minds, but it cannot
    elevate them. It has been asked, Why a woman should not learn the dead languages as well
    as the modern ones? For this plain reason, that the one are still spoken, and have
    immediate associations connected with them, and the other not. A woman may have a lover
    who is a Frenchman, or an Italian, or a Spaniard; and it is well to be provided against
    every contingency in that way. But what possible interest can she feel in those
    old-fashioned persons, the Greeks and Romans, or in what was done two thousand years ago?
    A modern widow would doubtless prefer Signor Tramezzani<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88'
    class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a> to Æneas, and Mr. Conway would be a
    formidable rival to Paris. No young lady in our days, in conceiving an idea of Apollo,
    can go a step beyond the image of her favourite poet: nor do we wonder that our old
    friend, the Prince Regent, passes for a perfect Adonis in the circles of beauty and
    fashion. Women in general have no ideas, except personal ones. They are mere egotists.
    They have no passion for truth, nor any love of what is purely ideal. They hate to think,
    and they hate every one who seems to think of anything but themselves. Everything is to
    them a perfect nonentity which does not touch their senses, their vanity, or their
    interest. Their poetry, their criticism, their politics, their morality, and their
    divinity, are downright affectation. That line in Milton is very striking—
<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He for God only, she for God in him.”<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a></div>

  </div>
</div>

    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>Such is the order of nature and providence; and we should be sorry to see any
    fantastic improvements on it. Women are what they were meant to be; and we wish for no
    alteration in their bodies or their minds. They are the creatures of the circumstances in
    which they are placed, of sense, of sympathy and habit. They are exquisitely susceptible
    of the passive impressions of things: but to form an idea of pure understanding or
    imagination, to feel an interest in <em>the true</em> and <em>the good</em> beyond
    themselves, requires an effort of which they are incapable. They want principle, except
    that which consists in an adherence to established custom; and this is the reason of the
    severe laws which have been set up as a barrier against every infringement of decorum and
    propriety in women. It has been observed by an ingenious writer of the present day, that
    women want imagination. This requires explanation. They have less of that imagination
    which depends on intensity of passion, on the accumulation of ideas and feelings round
    one object, on bringing all nature and all art to bear on a particular purpose, on
    continuity and comprehension of mind; but for the same reason, they have more fancy, that
    is greater flexibility of mind, and can more readily vary and separate their ideas at
    pleasure. The reason of that greater presence of mind which has been remarked in women
    is, that they are less in the habit of speculating on what is best to be done, and the
    first suggestion is decisive. The writer of this article confesses that he never met with
    any woman who could reason, and with but one reasonable woman. There is no instance of a
    woman having been a great mathematician or metaphysician or poet or painter: but they can
    dance and sing and act and write novels and fall in love, which last quality alone makes
    more than angels of them. Women are no judges of the characters of men, except <em>as
    men</em>. They have no real respect for men, or they never respect them for those
    qualities, for which they are respected by men. They in fact regard all such qualities as
    interfering with their own pretensions, and creating a jurisdiction different from their
    own. Women naturally wish to have their favourites all to themselves, and flatter their
    weaknesses to make them more dependent on their own good opinion, which, they think, is
    all that they want. We have, indeed, seen instances of men, equally respectable and
    amiable, equally admired by the women and esteemed by the men, but who have been ruined
    by an excess of virtues and accomplishments.’ Leigh Hunt replied to these remarks in the
    following number of the Round Table series (February 19, 1815), where he makes
    interesting reference to Hazlitt’s appearance and powers.

    <dd><em>Than his sentiments.</em> In <cite>The Examiner</cite> appears the following note on
    this passage: ‘We find persons who write what may be called an <em>impracticable</em>
    style; and their ideas are just as impracticable. They have as little tact of what is
    going on in the world as of the habitual meaning of words. Other writers betray their
    natural disposition by affectation, dryness, or levity of style. Style is the adaptation
    of words to things. Dr. Johnson had no style, that is, no scale of words answering to the
    differences of his subject. He always translated his ideas into the highest and most
    imposing form of expression, or more properly, into Latin words with English
    terminations. Goldsmith said to him, “If you had to write a fable, and to introduce
    little fishes speaking, you would make them talk like great whales.” It is a satire on
    this kind of taste that the most ignorant pretenders are in general what is generally
    understood by the finest writers. Women generally write a good style, because they
    express themselves according to the impression which things make upon them, without the
    affectation of authorship. They have besides more sense of propriety than men.’ For the
    story of Goldsmith see Boswell’s <cite>Life of Johnson</cite> (ed. G. B. Hill), ii. 231.

    brawny lay-brother of a neighbouring monastery, to whom she was lavish of her favours.
    The head of the order remonstrated with her on this preference shown to one whom he
    represented as a very low, ignorant fellow, and set forth the superior pretensions of
    himself, and his more learned brethren. The lady having heard him to an end made answer:

    ‘appeared about thirty years since, Mr. Scott of Amwell, whose volume of poetry obtained
    the marked approbation of our acknowledged best critics.’ Johnson said of John Scott of
    Amwell’s (1730–1783) <cite>Elegies</cite>, ‘they are very well; but such as twenty people
    might write’ (Boswell’s <cite>Life of Johnson</cite>, ed. G. B. Hill, ii. 351). Another
    correspondent, signing himself ‘B. B.,’ wrote a letter to <cite>The Examiner</cite>
    (September 24, 1815), protesting against Hazlitt’s sketch of Quakerism. This was no doubt
    Bernard Barton (1784–1849), another Quaker poet, and afterwards the friend of Lamb.

    <dd><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>At the end of this essay in <cite>The Examiner</cite> Hazlitt added the following
    ‘Note Extraordinary’: ‘We had just concluded our ramble with <em>Puck</em> and
    <em>Bottom</em>, and were beginning to indulge in some less airy recreations, when in
    came the last week’s <cite>Cobbett</cite>,<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93'
    class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a> and with one blow overset our Round
    Table, and marred all our good things. If while Mr. C. and his lady are sitting in their
    garden at Botley, like Adam and Eve in Paradise, the delight of one another, the envy of
    their neighbours, and the admiration of the rest of the world, suddenly a large fat hog
    from the wilds of Hampshire should bolt right through the hedge, and with snorting
    menaces and foaming tusks, proceed to lay waste the flower-pots and root up the potatoes,
    such as the surprise and indignation of so economical a couple would be on this occasion,
    was the consternation at our Table when Mr. Cobbett himself made his appearance among us,
    vowing vengeance against Milton and Shakespear, <em>Sir Hugh Evans</em> and <em>Justice
    Shallow</em>, and all the delights of human life. We were not prepared for such an onset.
    More barbarous than Mr. Wordsworth’s calling Voltaire dull,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94'
    class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a> or than Voltaire’s calling Cato the
    only English tragedy;<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' style='text-decoration: none;
    '><sup>[95]</sup></a> more barbarous than Mr. Locke’s admiration of Sir Richard
    Blackmore; more barbarous than the declaration of a German Elector—afterwards made into
    an English king—that he hated poets and painters; more barbarous than the Duke of
    Wellington’s letter to Lord Castlereagh,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96'
    class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> or than the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue
    Raisonné</span></cite> of the Flemish Masters published in the <cite>Morning
    Chronicle</cite>,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' style='text-decoration: none;
    '><sup>[97]</sup></a> or than the Latin style of the second Greek scholar<a id='r98' /><a
    href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a> of the age, or the
    English style of the first:—more barbarous than any or all of these is Mr. Cobbett’s
    attack on our two great poets. As to Milton, except the fine egotism of the situation of
    Adam and Eve, which Mr. Cobbett has applied to himself, there is not much in him to touch
    our politician: but we cannot understand his attack upon Shakespear, which is cutting his
    own throat. If Mr. Cobbett is for getting rid of his kings and queens, his fops and his
    courtiers, if he is for pelting <em>Sir Hugh</em> and <em>Falstaff</em> off the stage,
    yet what will he say to <em>Jack Cade</em> and First and Second Mob? If we are to scout
    the Roman rabble, where will the <cite>Register</cite> find English readers? Has the
    author never found himself out in Shakespear? He may depend upon it he is there, for all
    the people that ever lived are there! Has he never been struck with the valour of
    <em>Ancient Pistol</em>, who “would not swagger in any shew of resistance to a
    Barbary-hen”?<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' style='text-decoration: none;
    '><sup>[99]</sup></a> Can he not, upon occasion, “aggravate his voice”<a id='r100' /><a
    href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a> like <em>Bottom</em> in
    the play? In absolute insensibility, he is a fool to <em>Master Barnardine</em>; and
    there is enough of gross animal instinct in <em>Calyban</em> to make a whole herd of
    Cobbetts. Mr. Cobbett admires Bonaparte; and yet there is nothing finer in any of his
    addresses to the French people than what <cite>Coriolanus</cite> says to the Romans when
    they banish him. He abuses the Allies in good set terms; yet one speech of Constance
    describes them and their magnanimity better than all the columns of the <cite>Political
    Register</cite>. Mr. Cobbett’s address to the people of England<a id='r101' /><a
    href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a> on the alarm of an
    invasion, which was stuck on all the church-doors in Great Britain, was not more eloquent
    than <em>Henry V.’s</em> address to his soldiers before the battle of Agincourt; nor do
    we think Mr. Cobbett was ever a better specimen of the common English character than the
    two soldiers in the same play. After all, there is something so droll in his falling foul
    of Shakespear for want of delicacy, with his desperate lounges and bear-garden dexterity,
    snorting, fuming, and grunting, that we cannot help laughing at the affair, now that our
    surprise is over; as we suppose Mr. Cobbett does, if he can only keep him out of his
    premises by hallooing and hooting or dry blows, to see his old friend, Grill,<a id='r102'
    /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a> trudging along the
    highroad in search of his acorns and pig-nuts.’

    <dd>Note. <em>The idea is in ‘Don Quixote.’</em> Part <span class='fss'>II.</span> Chap,
    xlviii. In <cite>The Examiner</cite> this note was concluded as follows: ‘Much the same
    impression which the sight of the Queen of France made on Mr. Burke’s brain sixteen years
    before the French Revolution, did the reading of the New Eloise make on mine at the
    commencement of it. “Such is the stuff of which our dreams are made!”<a id='r103' /><a
    href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a> This man (Burke), who
    was a half poet and a half philosopher, has done more mischief than perhaps any other
    person in the world. His understanding was not competent to the discovery of any truth,
    but it was sufficient to palliate a lie; his reasons, of little weight in themselves,
    thrown into the scale of power, were dreadful. Without genius to adorn the beautiful, he
    had the art to throw a dazzling veil over the deformed and disgusting, and to strew the
    flowers of imagination over the rotten carcase of corruption, not to prevent, but to
    communicate the infection. His jealousy of Rousseau<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104'
    class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a> was one chief cause of his
    opposition to the French Revolution. The writings of the one had changed the institutions
    of a kingdom; while the speeches of the other, with the intrigues of his whole party, had
    changed nothing but the <em>turnspit of the King’s kitchen</em>.<a id='r105' /><a
    href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a> He would have blotted
    out the broad, pure light of Heaven, because it did not first shine in upon the narrow,
    crooked passages of St. Stephen’s Chapel. The genius of Rousseau had levelled the towers
    of the Bastile with the dust; our zealous reformist, who would rather be doing mischief
    than nothing, tried therefore to patch them up again, by calling that loathsome dungeon
    the King’s Castle, and by fulsome adulation of the virtues of a Court Strumpet. This man
    had the impudence to say<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' style='text-decoration: none;
    '><sup>[106]</sup></a> that an Elector of Hanover was raised to the throne of these
    kingdoms, “in contempt of the will of the people,” while the hereditary successor was
    still alive. He was at once a liar, a coward, and a slave; a liar to his own heart, a
    coward to the success of his own cause, a slave to the power he despised. See his Letter
    about the Duke of Bedford, in which the man gets the better of the sycophant, and he
    belabours the Duke in good earnest. It is not a source of regret to reflect that he
    closed his eyes on the ruin of liberty, which he had been the principal means of
    effecting, and of his own projects, at the same time. He did not live to see that
    deliverance of mankind, bound hand and foot into the absolute, lasting, inexorable power
    of Kings and Priests, which the author of Joan of Arc<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107'
    class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a> has so triumphantly celebrated. He
    did not live to see the sending of the Liberales of Spain to the gallies, and the
    liberating the Afrancesadoes from prison, for which our romantic Laureate, who sees so
    much farther into futurity than the Edinburgh Reviewers,<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108'
    class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a> thanks God. He did not live to read
    that Sonnet<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' style='text-decoration: none;
    '><sup>[109]</sup></a> to the King which Mr. Wordsworth has written, in imitation of
    Milton’s Sonnet to Cromwell. There is a species of literary prostitution which has sprung
    up and spread wide in these days, more nauseous and despicable than any recorded in
    Juvenal. It proves, however, one thing, that is, the force which knowledge and opinion
    have acquired, and which makes it worth while for power to court and pervert those
    faculties which were intended to enlighten and reform the world, in order to plunge it
    into a darkness that may be felt; and slavery, that can only cease by putting a stop to
    the propagation of the species.’ Hazlitt used a part of this passage as a note to his
    essay ‘On Good-Nature.’ See <em>post</em>, p. 105 note.

    <dd><em>To touch them.</em> In <cite>The Examiner</cite> Hazlitt gives the following note to
    this passage: ‘This may seem obscure. We will therefore avail ourselves of our privilege
    to explain as Members of Parliament do, when they let fall any thing too paradoxical,
    novel, or abstruse, to be immediately apprehended by the other side of the House. When
    the Widow Wadman<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' style='text-decoration: none;
    '><sup>[110]</sup></a> looked over my Uncle Toby’s map of the Siege of Namur with him,
    and as he pointed out the approaches of his battalion in a transverse line across the
    plain to the gate of St. Nicholas, kept her hand constantly pressed against his, if my
    Uncle Toby had then “been an artist and could paint,” (as Mr. Fox wished himself to be,<a
    id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a> that “he
    might draw Bonaparte’s conduct to the King of Prussia in the blackest colours”) my Uncle
    Toby would have drawn the hand of his fair enemy in the manner we have above described.
    We have heard a good story of this same Bonaparte playing off a very ludicrous parody of
    the Widow Wadman’s stratagem upon as great a commander by sea as my Uncle Toby was by
    land. Now, when Sir Isaac Newton, who was sitting smoking with his mistress’s hand in
    his, took her little finger and made use of it as a tobacco-pipe stopper, there was here
    a total absence of mind, or a great want of gusto.’

    one the property of the others. It was of the disciples of <em>his</em> school, where
    principle is converted into passion, that Mr. Burke said and said truly,—“Once a Jacobin,
    and always a Jacobin!” The adept in this school does not so much consider the political
    injury as the personal insult. This is the way to put the case, to set the true
    revolutionary leaven, the self-love which is at the bottom of every heart, at work, and
    this was the way in which Rousseau put it. It then becomes a question between man and
    man, which there is but one way of deciding.’

    <dd><em>A late number</em>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</span></i> <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, vol. xxi. July
    1813. The <cite>Correspondance</cite> of Friedrich Melchior, Baron Grimm (1723–1807) was
    published in 1812–14. The article in the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> is by Jeffrey. Hazlitt,
    in <cite>The Examiner</cite>, quotes from it at greater length, and proceeds: ‘These
    remarks, however shrewd and ingenious in themselves, are somewhat irrelevant to the
    literary and philosophical character of Mr. Grimm and his friends. There seems to have
    been an odd transposition of ideas in the writer’s mind; for the whole of his reasoning
    relates to the manners of fashionable life, or the tendency of mixed and agreeable
    society in general, to produce levity and insensibility, and does not at all apply to the
    peculiar defects of the literary character, or account for that hard-heartedness, which
    Mr. Burke attributes, by way of emphasis, to the <em>thorough-bred metaphysician</em>.<a
    id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a> The two
    characters are evidently distinct, and proceed from very different and even opposite
    causes, which ought not to have been confounded. It would have been a task worthy of the
    Edinburgh Reviewers to have pointed out the sources of each, and to have shewn how both
    appear to have united in the present instance with the natural levity of the French
    character, to produce that “faultless monster which the world ne’er saw” before.<a
    id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a> Much is
    undoubtedly to be given to accidental and local circumstances. Boswell’s Life of Johnson
    presents a very different picture of men and manners from Grimm’s Memoirs, though in the
    circle described by the former there were men who at least rivalled M. Grimm in
    literature, and in politeness and knowledge of mankind might vie with Baron d’Holbach.
    The profligacy of the French court, and the mummeries of the established religion might
    naturally produce an almost satiric license and impudence among the enlightened partisans
    of the new order of things, and lead them to regard all religion as a barefaced cheat,
    and every pretension to virtue as hypocrisy. The peculiar intelligible features of the
    philosophical and literary character are, however, stamped on every page of M. Grimm’s
    correspondence; and as they do not seem to have been very well distinguished by the
    Reviewer, I shall venture to throw out a few hints on the subject, in the hope that they
    may be taken up and embodied in an authentic form in some future supplementary volume.’

    <dd>Hazlitt’s letter in <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> concluded as follows: ‘There is
    another very striking distinction between the indifference and insensibility to moral
    good and evil, to be met with in the philosopher or the man of the world, which the
    Reviewer has not pointed out. In the one, it is the effect of “frivolity, dissipation,
    and familiarity with vice”; in the other, it is oftener the effect of disappointed hope
    and early enthusiasm. The aversion of the philosopher to moral speculations has almost
    always the same source as the exclamation of Brutus, “Oh Virtue! I embraced thee as a
    substance, and I find thou art a shadow!” There is hardly any one of the persons who
    figure in these memoirs who did not set out with some panacea for the salvation of
    mankind, with as much sanguine extravagance as ever knight-errants indulged to conquer
    giants and rescue distressed damsels. The wounds received in the conflict might close,
    but the scar would remain. Indeed, the practical knowledge of vice and misery makes a
    stronger impression on the mind, when it has once imbibed a habit of abstract reasoning.
    Evil thus becomes embodied in a general principle, and shews its happy form in all
    things. It is a fatal, inevitable necessity hanging over us. It follows us wherever we
    go—if we fly into the uttermost parts of the earth, it is there; whether we turn to the
    right or the left, we cannot escape from it.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘This, it is true, is the disease of philosophy; but it is one to which it is liable in
    minds of a certain cast, after the first ardour of expectation has been disabused by
    experience, and the finer feelings have received an irrecoverable shock from the jarring
    of the world.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘There seems a peculiar tenaciousness in the French character in this respect, an
    unfortunate aptitude to cling to every vice and catch at every folly, or else a want of
    freshness of feeling, of that elastic force about the heart which repels the approach of
    moral or intellectual depravity.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘What is said of the tone of the literary society of Paris, is equally misunderstood. The
    Reviewers hardly mean to represent the exclusion of tediousness and pertinacious
    wrangling, as the general character of assemblies of wits, and philosophers in all ages
    and nations. If so, their opinion differs from that of the Sage. The fact is, that the
    men of letters at this period, by mixing in the fashionable circles, took the tone of
    good company, as the people of fashion, by their familiarity with men of letters,
    received the tincture of philosophy. The two characters were blended together in real
    life, and are confounded in the Edinburgh Review.’

    <cite>The Examiner</cite> this note forms part of the text. At the end of the passage
    quoted Hazlitt proceeds: ‘The whole of Colley Cibber’s work is very amusing to a dramatic
    amateur. It gives an interesting account of the progress of the stage, which in his time
    appears to have been in a state <em>militant</em>. Two actors, <em>Kynaston</em> and
    <em>Montfort</em> were run through the body in disputes with gentlemen, with impunity;
    and the Master of the Revels arrested any of the two companies who was refractory to the
    managers, at his pleasure. <em>Dogget</em> was brought up in this manner from Norwich, by
    two constables: but <em>Dogget</em> being a whig, and a surly fellow, got a
    <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Habeas Corpus</span></i>, and the Master of the Revels was driven from the field.’
    Edward Kynaston (1640–1706) was beaten more than once at the instance of Sir Charles
    Sedley whom he impersonated on the stage. For the story of the Lord Chamberlain and
    Dogget, see Cibber’s <cite>Apology</cite> (Chap. x.).

    or, The Bible the best guide to political skill and foresight: A Lay Sermon, addressed to
    the Higher Classes of Society</cite> (1816), known as the first Lay Sermon. Hazlitt wrote

papers entitled ‘Fragments on Art. Why the Arts are not progressive?’ Later in
the year he contributed two papers to <cite>The Champion</cite> (August 28, 1814, and
September 11, 1814) under the heading ‘Fine Arts. Whether they are promoted
by Academies and Public Institutions?’ and in a letter (October 2) replied to the
criticisms of a correspondent. The present ‘Fragment’ is composed of (1) the first
of the articles in <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> and part of the second, and (2) part of the
second article in <cite>The Champion</cite>. Much of the matter of the present essay is embodied

    rather to common opinion than to our own. However inferior the style of his best
    landscapes may be, there is something in the execution that redeems all defects. In taste
    and grace nothing can ever go beyond them. He might be called, if not the perfect, the
    faultless painter. Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say, that there would be another Raphael,
    before there was another Claude. In Mr. Northcote’s Dream of a Painter (see his
    <cite>Memoirs of Sir Joshua Reynolds</cite>), there is an account of Claude Lorraine, so
    full of feeling, so picturesque, so truly classical, so like Claude, that we cannot
    resist this opportunity of copying it out.’ The passage quoted from Northcote is the

<h3 class='c010'>A LETTER TO WILLIAM GIFFORD, ESQ.</h3>

<p class='c011'>William Gifford (1756–1826), the son of a glazier, after a neglected childhood,
during which he was at one time apprenticed to a shoemaker, entered Exeter
College, Oxford, through the kindness of a friend, and graduated in 1782. His
two satires, <cite>The Baviad</cite> (1791) and <cite>The Mæviad</cite> (1795), were published together in
1797, and his translation of Juvenal, upon which he had been working since he left
Oxford, in 1802. He became editor of <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> (1797), and was the first
editor (1809–1824) of <cite>The Quarterly Review</cite>. He published a translation of Persius
in 1821, and editions of some of the old dramatists: Massinger (1805), Ben
Jonson (1816), Ford (1827), and Shirley (completed by Dyce, 1833). In <cite>The
Examiner</cite> for June 14, 1818, appeared a ‘Literary Notice,’ entitled ‘The Editor of
the Quarterly Review,’ which Hazlitt incorporated in the present ‘Letter.’</p>

    for February 7, 1819 (not February 9, as Hazlitt says), and opened a subscription list
    for Rogers. The two clergymen referred to took an active part against Rogers. Wellesley,
    a brother of the Duke of Wellington, was Rector of Chelsea, and Butler had a school there.

piece, ‘My First Acquaintance with Poets.’</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 1805 he produced his essay on the Principles of Human Action. Being no
metaphysician, I have never read this work; but Mr. Leslie Stephen, who is a
very competent person in these matters, I am told, assures me (<em>D. N. B.</em>) that it
is ‘scrupulously dry,’ though ‘showing great acuteness.’ This, I take leave to say—this
is Hazlitt all over. None has written of the workaday elements in life and
time with a rarer taste, a finer relish, a stronger confidence in himself and them.
Yet, in dealing with absolutes in life and time, he is ‘scrupulously dry.’ This, I
take it, is to be a man of letters.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>John Hazlitt had been a pupil of Reynolds, and his miniatures were welcome
at the Academy.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He had a painter in him, whether imperfectly developed or not; for he
would condescend upon none but Guido, Raphael, Titian.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One was a likeness of his father, of which he has written in eloquent and
engaging terms; another, a <em>Wordsworth</em>, which he destroyed; a third, the picture
of Elia, ‘as a Venetian senator,’ now in the National Portrait Gallery; yet
another, the presentment of an Old Woman, which is likened to a Rembrandt.
Having seen none of these things, all I can say about them is that Hazlitt seems
to have been passionately interested in colour; that he loved a picture because it
was a piece of painting; and, if he knew not always bad (or rather third and
fourth rate) work when he saw it, was as contemptuous of it, when he realised
its status, as Fuseli himself.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is an immense, even an insuperable difference between the two sorts of
sensualists. To take an immediate instance: Lamb loved Hogarth, and found
emotions in him, because he (Hogarth) was a novelist in paint; while Titian’s
<cite>Bacchus and Ariadne</cite> touched his sense of letters, and, as Mr. Ainger has
noted, suggested to him so much literature, or, at all events, so many literary
possibilities, that Titian could not but be an arch-painter. Hazlitt felt his
painter first, and thought not of the man-of-letters in his painter till his interest in
his painter’s painting was—I won’t say extinguished but—allayed.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘The point in debate,’ he says, ‘the worth or the bad quality of the painting
... I am as well able to decide upon as any who ever brandished a pallette.’ I
doubt not that he spoke the truth; yet the residuum of his criticisms of pictures,
their after-taste, is mostly literary. And, as he was finally a man of letters, what
else could one expect?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Leigh Hunt said that he was the best art critic that ever lived: that to read
him was like seeing a picture through stained glass, and so forth. But Leigh Hunt

had, however, no sort of sympathy with those who held the ‘social glass’ to be
Man’s safest introduction to the Pit. He only said that liquor did not agree with
him, and looked on cheerfully while his friends—Lamb was as close as any—drank
as they pleased.</p>

<cite>Quarterly</cite>. The style of these ‘reviews’ is abject; the inspiration venal; the
matter the very dirt of the mind. Gifford hated Hazlitt for his politics, and set out
to wither Hazlitt’s repute as a man of letters. For the tremendous reprisal with
which he was visited, the reader is referred to the <em>Letter to William Gifford, Esq.</em>,
in the first volume of the present Edition. If he find it over-savage: probably,
being of to-day, he will: let him turn to his <cite>Quarterly</cite>, and consider, if he have

Géricault and Bonington and de Vigny, and the rest of its heroes—he seems to
have known nothing. That was his way. The new did not exist for him. A
dissenter by birth and conviction, he yet cared only for the past, and the elder
‘glories of our blood and state’ were to him, not shadows but, the sole substantial
things he could keep room for in the kingdom of his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r28'>28</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His summary of the fight between Hickman and Bill Neate is alone in
literature, as also in the annals of the Ring. Jon Bee was an intelligent creature
of his kind, and knew a very great deal more about pugilism than Hazlitt knew;
but to contrast the two is to learn much. Badcock (which is Jon Bee) had seen
(and worshipped) Jem Belcher, and had reported fights with an extreme contempt
for Pierce Egan, the illiterate ass who gave us <em>Boxiana</em>. Hazlitt, however, looked
on at the proceedings of Neate and the Gaslight Man exactly as he had looked on
at divers creations of Edmund Kean. He saw the essentials in both expressions of
human activity, and his treatment of both is fundamentally the same. In both he
ignores the trivial: here the acting (in its lowest sense), there the hits that did not
count. And thus, as he gives you only the vital touches, you know how and why
Neate beat Hickman, and can tell the exact moment at which Hickman began to be
a beaten man. ’Tis the same with his panegyric on Cavanagh, the fives-player. For
a blend of gusto with understanding I know but one thing to equal with this: the
note on Dr. Grace, which appeared in <cite>The National Observer</cite>; and the night that
that was written, I sent the writer back to Hazlitt’s <cite>Cavanagh</cite>, and said to him
——! On the whole the <cite>Dr. Grace</cite> is the better of the two. But it has scarce
the incorruptible fatness of the <cite>Cavanagh</cite>. Gusto, though, is Hazlitt’s special
attribute: he glories in what he likes, what he reads, what he feels, what he
writes. He triumphed in his Kean, his Shakespeare, his Bill Neate, his Rousseau,
his coffee-and-cream and <em>Love for Love</em> in the inn-parlour at Alton. He relished
things; and expressed them with a relish. That is his ‘note.’ Some others have
relished only the consummate expression of nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r29'>29</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Listen, else, to Lamb himself: ‘Protesting against much that he has written,
and some things which he chooses to do; judging him by his conversation which
I enjoyed so long, and relished so deeply; or by his books, in those places where
no clouding passion intervenes, I should belie my own conscience if I said less
than that I think W. H. to be, in his natural and healthy state, one of the wisest
and finest spirits breathing. So far from being ashamed of that intimacy which
was betwixt us, it is my boast that I was able for so many years to have preserved
it entire; and I think I shall go to my grave without finding or expecting to find
such another companion.’ Thus does one Royalty celebrate the kingship and
enrich the immortality of another.</p>

the general style of that number is his; though, from the story being related
personally of Bickerstaff, who is also represented as having been at that time in

course of conversation. The particular incident is much more like a story of his

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r38'>38</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Wordsworth, who has written a sonnet to the King on the good that he
has done in the last fifty years, has made an attack on a set of gipsies for having
done nothing in four and twenty hours. ‘The stars had gone their rounds, but
they had not stirred from their place.’ And why should they, if they were comfortable
where they were? We did not expect this turn from Mr. Wordsworth,
whom we had considered as the prince of poetical idlers, and patron of the philosophy
of indolence, who formerly insisted on our spending our time ‘in a wise
passiveness.’ Mr. W. will excuse us if we are not converts to his recantation of
his original doctrine; for he who changes his opinion loses his authority. We
did not look for this Sunday-school philosophy from him. What had he himself
been doing in these four and twenty hours? Had he been admiring a flower, or
writing a sonnet? We hate the doctrine of utility, even in a philosopher, and
much more in a poet: for the only real utility is that which leads to enjoyment,
and the end is, in all cases, better than the means. A friend of ours from the
North of England proposed to make Stonehenge of some use, by building houses
with it. Mr. W.’s quarrel with the gipsies is an improvement on this extravagance,
for the gipsies are the only living monuments of the first ages of society.
They are an everlasting source of thought and reflection on the advantages and
disadvantages of the progress of civilisation: they are a better answer to the cotton
manufactories than Mr. W. has given in the <cite>Excursion</cite>. ‘They are a grotesque
ornament to the civil order.’ We should be sorry to part with Mr. Wordsworth’s
poetry, because it amuses and interests us: we should be still sorrier to part with
the tents of our old friends, the Bohemian philosophers, because they amuse and
interest us more. If any one goes a journey, the principal event in it is his meeting
with a party of gipsies. The pleasantest trait in the character of Sir Roger de
Coverley, is his interview with the gipsy fortune-teller. This is enough.</p>

and Jonathan Edwards. The work of the latter on the Will is written with as much
power of logic, and more in the true spirit of philosophy, than any other metaphysical
work in the language. His object throughout is not to perplex the
question, but to satisfy his own mind and the reader’s. In general, the principle
of dissent arises more from want of sympathy and imagination, than from strength
of reason. The spirit of contradiction is not the spirit of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r46'>46</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The late ingenious Baron Grimm, of acute critical memory, was up to the
merit of the <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite>. In his Correspondence, he says, ‘If it be true that
the nearer a writer is to Nature, the more certain he is of pleasing, it must be
allowed that the English, in their dramatic pieces, have greatly the advantage over
us. There reigns in them an inestimable tone of nature, which the timidity of
our taste has banished from French pieces. M. Patu has just published, in two
volumes, <em>A selection of smaller dramatic pieces, translated from the English</em>, which will
eminently support what I have advanced. The principal one among this selection
is the celebrated <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite> of Gay, which has had such an amazing run in
England. We are here in the very worst company imaginable; the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dramatis Personæ</span></i>
are robbers, pickpockets, gaolers, prostitutes, and the like; yet we are highly
amused, and in no haste to quit them; and why? Because there is nothing in
the world more original or more natural. There is no occasion to compare our
most celebrated comic operas with this, to see how far we are removed from truth
and nature, and this is the reason that, notwithstanding our wit, we are almost
always flat and insipid. Two faults are generally committed by our writers, which
they seem incapable of avoiding. They think they have done wonders if they have
only faithfully copied the dictionaries of the personages they bring upon the stage,
forgetting that the great art is to chuse the moments of character and passion in
those who are to speak, since it is those moments alone that render them interesting.
For want of this discrimination, the piece necessarily sinks into insipidity
and monotony. Why do almost all M. Vade’s pieces fatigue the audience to
death? Because all his characters speak the same language; because each is a
perfect resemblance of the other. Instead of this, in the <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite>, among
eight or ten girls of the town, each has her separate character, her peculiar traits,
her peculiar modes of expression, which give her a marked distinction from her
companions.’—Vol. i. p. 185.</p>

from this uniform character of violence and abruptness. It is consistent with
itself throughout. Entire deformity can only be found where the features have
not only no symmetry or softness in themselves, but have no connection with one
another, presenting every variety of wretchedness, and a jumble of all sorts of
defects, such as we see in Hogarth or in the streets of London; for instance, a
large bottle-nose, with a small mouth twisted awry.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a striking description in Mr. Burke’s Reflections of the late Queen of
France, whose charms had left their poison in the heart of this Irish orator and
patriot, and set the world in a ferment sixteen years afterwards. ‘And surely
never lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful
vision.’ The idea is in Don Quixote, where the Duenna speaks of the air with
which the Duchess ‘treads, or rather seems to disdain the ground she walks on.’
We have heard the same account of the gracefulness of Marie Antoinette from an
artist, who saw her at Versailles much about the same time that Mr. Burke did.
He stood in one corner of a little antechamber, and as the doors were narrow, she
was obliged to pass sideways with her hoop. She glided by him in an instant, as if
borne on a cloud.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f50'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r50'>50</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a fruit or flower-piece by Vanhuysum, the minutest details acquire a certain
grace and beauty from the delicacy with which they are finished. The eye dwells
with a giddy delight on the liquid drops of dew, on the gauze wings of an insect,
on the hair and feathers of a bird’s nest, the streaked and speckled egg-shells, the
fine legs of the little travelling caterpillar. Who will suppose that the painter had
not the same pleasure in detecting these nice distinctions in nature, that the critic
has in tracing them in the picture?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r51'>51</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We here allude particularly to Turner, the ablest landscape painter now
living, whose pictures are, however, too much abstractions of aerial perspective,
and representations not so properly of the objects of nature as of the medium
through which they are seen. They are the triumph of the knowledge of the
artist, and of the power of the pencil over the barrenness of the subject. They
are pictures of the elements of air, earth, and water. The artist delights to go
back to the first chaos of the world, or to that state of things when the waters
were separated from the dry land, and light from darkness, but as yet no living
thing nor tree bearing fruit was seen upon the face of the earth. All is ‘without
form and void.’ Some one said of his landscapes that they were <em>pictures of nothing,
and very like</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f52'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r52'>52</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Raphael not only could not paint a landscape; he could not paint people in a
landscape. He could not have painted the heads or the figures, or even the dresses,
of the St. Peter Martyr. His figures have always an <em>in-door</em> look, that is, a set,
determined, voluntary, dramatic character, arising from their own passions, or a
watchfulness of those of others, and want that wild uncertainty of expression, which
is connected with the accidents of nature and the changes of the elements. He has
nothing <em>romantic</em> about him.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r53'>53</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A good-natured man will always have a smack of pedantry about him. A
lawyer, who talks about law, <em>certioraris</em>, <em>noli prosequis</em>, and silk gowns, though he
may be a blockhead, is by no means dangerous. It is a very bad sign (unless
where it arises from singular modesty) when you cannot tell a man’s profession
from his conversation. Such persons either feel no interest in what concerns
them most, or do not express what they feel. ‘Not to admire any thing’ is a very
unsafe rule. A London apprentice, who did not admire the Lord Mayor’s coach,
would stand a good chance of being hanged. We know but one person absurd
enough to have formed his whole character on the above maxim of Horace, and
who affects a superiority over others from an uncommon degree of natural and
artificial stupidity.</p>

with all the pride of intellect, and with the deepest yearnings of the human heart.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r57'>57</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We shall here give one passage as an example, which has always appeared to
us the very perfection of this kind of personal and local description. It is that
where he gives an account of his being one of the choristers at the Cathedral at
Chambery: ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On jugera bien que la vie de la maîtrise toujours chantante et gaie,
avec les Musiciens et les Enfans de chœur, me plaisoit plus que celle du Séminaire
avec les Peres de S. Lazare. Cependant, cette vie, pour être plus libre, n’en étoit
pas moins égale et réglée. J’étois fait pour aimer l’indépendance et pour n’en
abuser jamais. Durant six mois entiers, je ne sortis pas une seule fois, que pour
aller chez Maman ou à l’Église, et je n’en fus pas même tenté. Cette intervalle est
un de ceux où j’ai vécu dans le plus grand calme, et que je me suis rappelé avec le
plus de plaisir. Dans les situations diverses où je me suis trouvé, quelques uns out
été marqués par un tel sentiment de bien-être, qu’en les remémorant j’en suis affecté
comme si j’y étois encore. Non seulement je me rappelle les tems, les lieux, les
personnes, mais tous les objets environnans, la température de l’air, son odeur, sa
couleur, une certaine impression locale qui ne s’est fait sentir que là, et dont le
souvenir vif m’y transporte de nouveau. Par exemple, tout ce qu’on répétait a la
maîtrise, tout ce qu’on chantoit au chœur, tout ce qu’on y faisoit, le bel et noble
habit des Chanoines, les hasubles des Prêtres, les mitres des Chantres, la figure des
Musiciens, un vieux Charpentier boiteux qui jouoit de la contrebasse, un petit Abbé
biondin qui jouoit du violon, le lambeau de soutane qu’après avoir posé son épée,
M. le Maître endossoit par-dessus son habit laïque, et le beau surplis fin dont il en
couvrait les loques pour aller au chœur; l’orgueil avec lequel j’allois, tenant ma
petite flûte à bec, m’établir dans l’orchestre, à la tribune, pour un petit bout de récit
que M. le Maître avoit fait exprès pour moi: le bon diner qui nous attendoit
ensuite, le bon appétit qu’on y portoit:—ce concours d’objets vivement retracé m’a
cent fois charmé dans ma mémoire, autant et plus que dans la realité. J’ai gardé
toujours une affection tendre pour un certain air du</span> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conditor alme syderum</span></i> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui
marche par iambes; parce qu’un Dimanche de l’Avent j’entendis de mon lit chanter
cette hymne, avant le jour, sur le perron de la Cathédrale, selon un rite de cette
eglise là. Mlle. <em>Merceret</em>, femme de chambre de Maman, savoit un peu de
musique; je n’oublierai jamais un petit motet <em>afferte</em>, que M. le Maître me fit
chanter avec elle, et que sa maîtresse écoutait avec tant de plaisir. Enfin tout,
jusqu’à la bonne servante <em>Perrine</em>, qui étoit si bonne fille, et que les enfans de chœur
faisoient tant endêver—tout dans les souvenirs de ces tems de bonheur et d’innocence
revient souvent me ravir et m’attrister.</span>’—<cite>Confessions</cite>, <span class='fss'>LIV.</span> iii. p. 283.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r59'>59</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This man (Burke) who was a half poet and a half philosopher, has done more
mischief than perhaps any other person in the world. His understanding was not
competent to the discovery of any truth, but it was sufficient to palliate a falsehood;
his reasons, of little weight in themselves, thrown into the scale of power,
were dreadful. Without genius to adorn the beautiful, he had the art to throw a
dazzling veil over the deformed and disgusting; and to strew the flowers of
imagination over the rotten carcass of corruption, not to prevent, but to communicate
the infection. His jealousy of Rousseau was one chief cause of his opposition
to the French Revolution. The writings of the one had changed the institutions
of a kingdom; while the speeches of the other, with the intrigues of his whole
party, had changed nothing but the <em>turnspit of the King’s kitchen</em>. He would have
blotted out the broad pure light of Heaven, because it did not first shine in at the
little Gothic windows of St. Stephen’s Chapel. The genius of Rousseau had
levelled the towers of the Bastile with the dust; our zealous reformist, who would
rather be doing mischief than nothing, tried, therefore, to patch them up again, by
calling that loathsome dungeon the King’s castle, and by fulsome adulation of the
virtues of a Court strumpet. This man,—but enough of him here.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r63'>63</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The following lively description of this actress is given by Cibber in his
Apology:—</p>

<p class='c000'>‘What found most employment for her whole various excellence at once, was
the part of Melantha, in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marriage-à-la-mode</span>. Melantha is as finished an impertinent
as ever fluttered in a drawing-room, and seems to contain the most
complete system of female foppery that could possibly be crowded into the tortured
form of a fine lady. Her language, dress, motion, manners, soul, and body, are
in a continual hurry to be something more than is necessary or commendable.
And though I doubt it will be a vain labour to offer you a just likeness of Mrs.
Montfort’s action, yet the fantastic impression is still so strong in my memory,
that I cannot help saying something, though fantastically, about it. The first
ridiculous airs that break from her are upon a gallant never seen before, who
delivers her a letter from her father, recommending him to her good graces as an
honourable lover. Here now, one would think she might naturally shew a little
of the sex’s decent reserve, though never so slightly covered! No, sir; not a tittle
of it; modesty is the virtue of a poor-soul’d country gentlewoman: she is too
much a court-lady, to be under so vulgar a confusion: she reads the letter, therefore,
with a careless, dropping lip, and an erected brow, humming it hastily over,
as if she were impatient to outgo her father’s commands, by making a complete
conquest of him at once: and that the letter might not embarrass her attack,
crack! she crumbles it at once into her palm, and pours upon him her whole
artillery of airs, eyes, and motion; down goes her dainty, diving body to the
ground, as if she were sinking under the conscious load of her own attractions;
then launches into a flood of fine language and compliment, still playing her chest
forward in fifty falls and risings, like a swan upon waving water; and, to complete
her impertinence, she is so rapidly fond of her own wit, that she will not
give her lover leave to praise it: Silent assenting bows, and vain endeavours to
speak, are all the share of the conversation he is admitted to, which at last he is
relieved from, by her engagement to half a score visits, which she <em>swims</em> from him
to make, with a promise to return in a twinkling.’—<cite>The Life of Colley Cibber</cite>,

He tells us in the same work (though this is hardly what I should call being ‘a

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
